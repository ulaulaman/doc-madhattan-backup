> It's actually quite concerning. For some time, many scientists had hoped that a warmer Earth might lead to more clouds and higher albedo, which would then help to moderate warming and balance the climate system. But this shows the opposite is true.

In this way **Edward Schwieterman**([1](#fn1)) commented the result of a new paper about the Earth's climate. But first of all we must say what is [albedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo):

> (...) is the measure of the diffuse reflection of solar radiation out of the total solar radiation and measured on a scale from 0, corresponding to a black body that absorbs all incident radiation, to 1, corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation.

Now, a black body, an idealized opaque, non-reflective body, emits a [thermal electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation) that we could estimate also for the Earth. If we modelled it as a perfect black body, we find a temperature about 254.356 K, or -18.8 °C. But if we consider also, for example, the albedo, we can find a temperature of 245 K for albedo equals to 0.4, and a temperature of 255 K for albedo equals to 0.3. So, if the albedo decreases, Earth's temperature increases. And this is exactly what the researchers found.
