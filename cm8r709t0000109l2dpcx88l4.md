> Few days before the formal acceptance of this paper, an independent study about the architecture of the *π Men* planetary system was published([1](#fn1)). The results of that work, based on public data and not including the ESPRESSO observations, confirm the high mutual inclination of the orbital planes of *π Men b* and *c*. Our results are in agreement with those of Xuan & Wyatt and are characterized by a better formal precision.([2](#fn2))

[*Pi Mensae*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_Mensae), or *π Men*, is a yellow dwarf star in the constellation of Mensa. We know that it has a little planetary system, constituted by two planets (or, if you prefer, we discover only two planets orbiting around *Pi Mensae*): *Pi Mensae b*, one of the most massive planets ever discovered, about 14.1 the mass of Jupiter, and *Pi Mensae c*, a super-Earth, about 4.5 the mass of our planet.  
In 2020, an analysis with Gaia DR2 and Hipparcos astrometry showed that planets *b* and *c* are located on orbits mutually inclined by 49°-131°, which causes planet *c* to not transit most of the time, and acquire large misalignments with its host star's spin axis([1](#fn1)).  
This result was discovered also by an italian team([2](#fn2)), but published just few days after on arXiv, using **ESPRESSO** (*Echelle Spectrograph for Rocky Exoplanet- and Stable Spectroscopic Observations*), a sèectrograph designed and developed in Italy by researchers of Brera's Astronomical Observatory at the Merate's laboratories. The instrument, mounted on the Very Large Telescope, has in a certain sense been tested with the planetary system of *Pi Mensae*, therefore, even coming seconds for a few, the result can be considered a success for the young ESPRESSO.
