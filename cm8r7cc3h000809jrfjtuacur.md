The [Schroedinger's cat](http://docmadhattan.fieldofscience.com/2011/11/00909090909-shroedingers-cat-and-powers.html) is a [thought experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger's_cat "Schroedinger's cat Wikipedia") proposed by **Erwin Schroedinger** in 1935 in order to proof the limits of quantum mechanics and Copenaghen interpretation. One of the most known consequence of the paradox is the many worlds interpretation, but also artist was inspired by the paradox. For example [**Chavdar Yordanov**](https://vimeo.com/chavdaryordanov) created a beautiful and funny animation with the music created by [**Sian Smith**](http://www.behance.net/siansmithmusic) (via [_Open Culture_](http://www.openculture.com/2017/03/the-famous-schrodingers-cat-thought-experiment-gets-brought-to-life-in-an-off-kilter-animation.html)).
