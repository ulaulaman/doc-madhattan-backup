In physics quantities _which change little under slow changes of parameter, are called adiabatic invariants_([1](#fn1)). The pendulum could be an adiabatic invariants. To get it, as well as to get any of the adiabatic invariants, _the person changing the parameters of the system must not see what state the system is in_([1](#fn1)).
