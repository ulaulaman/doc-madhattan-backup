One of the most famous speech by **Richard Feynman** is _There's plenty of room at the bottom_:

> Now comes the interesting question: How do we make such a tiny mechanism? I leave that to you. However, let me suggest one weird possibility. You know, in the atomic energy plants they have materials and machines that they can’t handle directly because they have become radioactive. To unscrew nuts and put on bolts and so on, they have a set of master and slave hands, so that by operating a set of levers here, you control the “hands” there, and can turn them this way and that so you can handle things quite nicely.

The idea is to manipulate molecules to build, for example, an electric engine, or a book, or something else. The most curious fact about the [Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2021](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2021/press-release/) is that **Johan Jarnestad** has illustrated the work of **Benjamin List** and **David MacMillan** using a couple of workers, an image that, in a particular way, is very similar to Feynman's idea.

> Building molecules is a difficult art. Benjamin List and David MacMillan are awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2021 for their development of a precise new tool for molecular construction: organocatalysis. This has had a great impact on pharmaceutical research, and has made chemistry greener.

I hope to write soon an article about Feynman and miniaturization obviously from the physics point of view.
