> [**Astrostatistics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrostatistics) is a discipline which spans astrophysics, statistical analysis and data mining. It is used to process the vast amount of data produced by automated scanning of the cosmos, to characterize complex datasets, and to link astronomical data to astrophysical theory. Many branches of statistics are involved in astronomical analysis including nonparametrics, multivariate regression and multivariate classification, time series analysis, and especially Bayesian inference.

The registration to the [1st Italian Astrostatistics School](http://iaa.mi.oa-brera.inaf.it/IAA/AstroStatisticsSchool.html) is open. Up to 35 members; until Monday, priority is given to doctoral students. From Monday, if you are interested, all can register to the school.
