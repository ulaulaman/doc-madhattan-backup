On Futility Closet, **Greg Ross** proposed an [interesting puzzle](http://www.futilitycloset.com/2011/05/20/square-deal-3/) that i reproduce in the following picture, using GeoGebra:

The result of the quest (calculate yellow area, or $A\_{EIBM}$) is 4 inch2. Why?  
First of all we must proof the congruence between $T\_{AEIBM}$ and $T\_{EKCJ}$, who is a square's quarter, and so $A\_{EKCJ} = 4$.  
First of all I proof the congruence between $T\_{EJI}$ and $T\_{ELM}$  
  
1) $\\widehat{LEM} = \\beta$ (definition)  
2) $\\widehat{IJE} = \\pi = \\widehat{ELM}$  
3) $\\widehat{IEL} = \\pi + \\beta = \\widehat{LEJ} + \\widehat{IEJ} = \\pi + \\widehat{IEJ}$ (using 2 and 3)  
4) So $\\widehat{IEJ} = \\beta = \\widehat{LEM}$  
5) $\\widehat{IJE} = \\pi = \\widehat{MLE}$  
6) $EJ = EL$ (construction)  
Following (4), (5), (6) (according to Euclide) $T\_{EJI} = T\_{ELM}$  
  
The conclusion is very simple:  
$S\_{EKCJ} = S\_{EJBL}$ for construction.  
Now, some calculation:  
\\\[A\_{EKCI} = A\_{EKCJ} - A\_{EIJ} = A\_{EJBL} - A\_{ELM} = A\_{EJBM}\\\]  
So we can calculate the requested area:  
\\\[A\_{EJI} + A\_{EJBM} = A\_{EJI} + A\_{EKCI} = 4\\\]
