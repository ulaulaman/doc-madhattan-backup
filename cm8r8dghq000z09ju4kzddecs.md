Using Google+ Hangout, CMS experiment realize a discussion session between two CMS physicists, **Joe Incandela** (spokesperson of CMS) and **Sue Ann Koay** and [CMS followers on Google Plus](https://plus.google.com/u/0/104252363924132346643):

The [next hangout event](https://plus.google.com/104252363924132346643/posts/gJe2hbvrJ95), with physicist also from [ATLAS](https://plus.google.com/117931032380025921950) and [CERN](https://plus.google.com/106123073424280939934), will be on the 4th April, 2012, from 16:00 to 17:30 Central European Summer Time (UTC +2). During the event I'm travelling, so I cannot participate, but I hope that someone of my readers will can participate to the hangout:

Google+ Hangout could became a good tool in order to comunicate with people, but I quest: it could became a good tool in order to realize a scientific conference? I think, for example, to the on-line round table realized in 2010 during the workshop "[Comunicare Fisica](http://agenda.infn.it/internalPage.py?pageId=0&confId=1538)" about the communication of physics.
