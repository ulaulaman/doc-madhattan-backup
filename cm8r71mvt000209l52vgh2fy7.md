I hope to write something about the Ising model in the next weeks, but in the meanwhile you can [read something about E8 group](http://docmadhattan.fieldofscience.com/2011/09/universe-and-flowers.html). Below you can find the mathematicians that awarded the Field Medals 2022:

* * *

**Hugo Duminil-Copin**

> For solving longstanding problems in the probabilistic theory of phase transitions in statistical physics, especially in dimensions three and four.

**June Huh**

> For bringing the ideas of Hodge theory to combinatorics, the proof of the Dowling–Wilson conjecture for geometric lattices, the proof of the Heron–Rota–Welsh conjecture for matroids, the development of the theory of Lorentzian polynomials, and the proof of the strong Mason conjecture.

**James Maynard**

> For contributions to analytic number theory, which have led to major advances in the understanding of the structure of prime numbers and in Diophantine approximation.

**Maryna Viazovska**

> For the proof that the E8 lattice provides the densest packing of identical spheres in 8 dimensions, and further contributions to related extremal problems and interpolation problems in Fourier analysis.
