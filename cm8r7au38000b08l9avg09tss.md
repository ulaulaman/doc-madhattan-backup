> [**Radhanath Sikdar**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radhanath_Sikdar) was an Indian mathematician who, among many other things, calculated the height of Mount Everest in the Himalaya and showed it to be the tallest mountain above sea level.

> In 1865, [Everest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Everest) was given its official English name by the _Royal Geographical Society_, upon a recommendation by **Andrew Waugh**, the _British Surveyor General of India_. As there appeared to be several different local names, Waugh chose to name the mountain after his predecessor in the post, Sir **George Everest**, despite George Everest's objections.
