A [**bubble chamber**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_chamber) is a pool filled with a liquid (typically hydrogen) such that its molecules are ionized to the passage of a charged particle, thus producing bubbles. In this way the trajectories of the particles are visible and it is possible to study the various decays(2).  
The bubble chamber was invented by **Donald Glaser**(1) in 1952, who win the Nobel Prize in 1960.
