One year later, **Chris Hadfield** uploaded a video of his version of _Space Oddity_ performed on the International Space Station. **David Bowie** had him a permission of one year and so, a couple of days ago, Chris Hadfield deleted the video, but you can see it on the YouTube channel of **Sky News**:

The most incredible thing is that, following Bowie's request, Hadfield's video is removed from his youtube channel, but it is reuploaded by other users and not only by Sky News...
