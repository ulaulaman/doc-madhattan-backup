It seems that are some experimental problems in [OPERA](http://operaweb.lngs.infn.it/?lang=en):

> The OPERA Collaboration, by continuing its campaign of verifications on the neutrino velocity measurement, has identified two issues that could significantly affect the reported result. The first one is linked to the oscillator used to produce the events time-stamps in between the GPS synchronizations. The second point is related to the connection of the optical fiber bringing the external GPS signal to the OPERA master clock.  
> These two issues can modify the neutrino time of flight in opposite directions. While continuing our investigations, in order to unambiguously quantify the effect on the observed result, the Collaboration is looking forward to performing a new measurement of the neutrino velocity as soon as a new bunched beam will be available in 2012. An extensive report on the above mentioned verifications and results will be shortly made available to the scientific committees and agencies.

I remember that alxo BOREXINO, an other experiment at Gran Sasso Laboratories, will try to measure neutrino's speed. Indeed the experimental mistake could preduce a higher velocity than the previous [collected data](http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.4897).
