It's not often that I have the opportunity to disagree with Einstein. I can't, however, accept that everyone "in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that some spirit is manifest in the laws of the universe..." I'd agree that this might be the case for some, but not all. The universe and the laws that govern it are silent on the question of god(s) existence. Myself, I believe in god(s). But I don't believe because I'm a scientist. And I don't believe in spite of my being a scientist. My being a scientist has absolutely nothing to do with my faith, which is just that faith.
