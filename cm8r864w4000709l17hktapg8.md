An electron encountered a positron: they are inexorably drawn towards each other, but their combination is intended to be fatal, and from their union remains only a photon, traveling... and traveling... and traveling... and occasionally it disappears, it decomposes into an electron and a positron. These, however, are futile images, as long as they do not possess enough energy to go away, to far away from each other.  
Until the next waltz.

The image (via [Quantum Diaries](http://www.quantumdiaries.org/2010/03/07/more-feynman-diagrams-momentum-conservation/)) represent a Feynman's diagram about the [electron-positron annihilation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron%E2%80%93positron_annihilation) and a next [pair production](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_production). In the middle of the diagram, there is the auto energy of the photon, and it is named _loop_, and the diagram, _loop diagram_.
