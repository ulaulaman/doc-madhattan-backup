He was born in Klu≈°ino on the 9th March, 1934; he died on the 27th March 1968, in a plane crash. His death and the controversy that followed and especially the pioneering gesture for which I remembered him today, make me pull over to **Hal Jordan**, a comic book superhero. In fact, [**Yuri Alekseevich Gagarin**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Gagarin), when he returned home from his space mission, was celebrated as a hero, as a man who was raised on humanity in all its stature: the 12nd April 12 1961 he had become **the first man to go in space**, completing one orbit around the Earth.

Yuri has thus paved the way for space, marking a key point in the path toward the Moon: at that time Russia was very close to winning that race in space that characterized the _Cold War_, but thanks to **Wernher von Braun**, United States _conquest_ the Moon before their opponents. In every case the importance of Gagarin and the Russian space school are now remembered for example with the movie [_First Orbit_](http://www.firstorbit.org/):
