When we are going to approach to the binary system Kepler-16 ([image source](http://kepler.nasa.gov/multimedia/AnimationsandMore/animations/artistsconcepts/?ImageID=168)) we'll see two different stars: the largest of the couple, the **star A**, is a K dwarf with a mass of about 0.69 solar mass and about 0.65 Sun's radius, and a little red dwarf, the **stra B**, with a mass of about 0.2 solar mass and about 0.23 Sun's radius. But when we'll arrive at about 0.5 au from the gravitational centre of the binary system we'll see a great surprise: a little planet _with a mass of 0.333 ± 0.016 and a radius of 0.7538 ± 0.0025 those of Jupiter_(1).

In this momenti is very difficult to suppose the properties(2) (like composition and surface temperature) of [Kepler-16b](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler-16b "Kepler-16b Wikipedia"), but the most important thing is that **Kepler can discover**, using the transit technique, **also a planet around a binary system!** I think that this is the principle reason becuase the paper was accepted by _Science_. And it's clear that all nerd and sci-fi fan think about Skywalker family's planet, Tatooine:

(2011). Kepler-16: A Transiting Circumbinary Planet Science, 333 (6049), 1602-1606 DOI: [10.1126/science.1210923](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1210923) ([pdf](http://exoplanet.eu/papers/Kepler-16.pdf))  
(2) In the paper we can read that the high density suggests _a greater degree of enrichment by heavy elements_. At the other hand

> Nevertheless, for any age greater than 0.5 Gyr, the planet’s interior would include 40-60 Earth masses of heavy elements according to standard planetary models(3). This would imply a composition of approximately half gas (hydrogen and helium) and half heavy elements (presumably ice and rock).

So I think that is not so correct write in press release

> Kepler-16b is cold, gaseous and not thought to harbor life

also because

> it more difficult to estimate the age \[of star A\] with theoretical evolutionary models

The surface temperature (170-200 K), instead, seems more certain.  
In every case Kepler-16b is a death planet...
