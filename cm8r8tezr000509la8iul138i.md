Dear readers, if you want to submit your shots about the lunar eclipse, you can use the [following form](http://ulaulaman.tumblr.com/submit) (probably you must join on tumblr, I don't remember the options of the submission...).  
And now I propose you two _learning object_ about eclipse.  
First of all an _aplett_ from the [Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/flash/0,5860,419794,00.html):  

If you want, you can joy with the [McGraw-Hill simulation](http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/olcweb/cgi/pluginpop.cgi?it=swf::800::600::/sites/dl/free/0072482621/78778/Eclipses_Nav.swf::Eclipse%20Interactive), an application in which you can change some parameters and so learn how lunar eclipse works.  
Another interesting learning object is proposed by [msnbc.com](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11947384/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/what-causes-lunar-eclipse/).  
And now... A good eclipse to all readers!
