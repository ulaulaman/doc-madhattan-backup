A slight correction: The colourful illustration of the torus is just the standard way to depict a torus, but is nowhere near to being a flat torus. On the contrary: In this picture we can clearly see the positively curved regions (as on the top of the picture, where the surface curves down in all directions and looks like part of a sphere) and the negatively curved regions (imagine standing "inside" the hole, where the surface is curved like a Pringles potato chip).
