> The Jovian moon Io, imaged by SHARK-VIS@LBT on January 10, 2024. The red, green, and blue channels of this tri-color image show the I (infrared), R (red), and V (green) spectral bands, respectively (corresponding at wavelengths of 755, 620 and 550 nanometers). This is the highest resolution image of Io ever obtained from a ground-based telescope.
