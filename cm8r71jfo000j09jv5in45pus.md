**Alan Turing** was fascinated by mathematical patterns found in nature. In particular, he noticed that the Fibonacci sequence often occurred in sunflower seed heads. However, his theory that sunflower heads featured Fibonacci number sequences was left unfinished when he died in 1954, but [some years ago a citizen science project](http://docmadhattan.fieldofscience.com/2013/08/turing-fibonacci-and-sunflowers.html) led by the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester and the Manchester Science Festival has found examples of Fibonacci sequences and other mathematical sequences in more than 500 sunflowers.  
Inspired by this, [I suggest a prompt to NightCafe](https://creator.nightcafe.studio/creation/zbYv4Rl2NOWdnN8lxdiB?ru=ulaulaman), a text-to-image generator to celbrate Turing and his unstoppable mind:
