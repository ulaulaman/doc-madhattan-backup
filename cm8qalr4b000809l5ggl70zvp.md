This is my first post for **Doc Madhattan**. First of all the explenation of the name of this new blog: I'm a theoretical physics, so I have two research fileds, physics and maths. But I have also another big passion: comics!  
So I decide to combine this elements in a name who combine **Doc Manhattan**, from **Alan Moore**'s *Watchmen*, with **Lewis Carroll**'s **Mad Hatter**, and here comes the name: **Doc Madhattan**!  
The next step is the choice of blogging system, and some weeks ago (thanks to [Michele](https://profiles.google.com/u/0/michele.cascarano/about)!) I discovered [Field of Science](http://www.fieldofscience.com/) and I immediatly think:  
  
*It's a good place to open a science blog in English language! There are good science blogs, here, and I think very good people!*  
  
The first welcome from [Edward](http://www.blogger.com/profile/04295927435118827266) is very good and I'm happy of my choice. So in the next months you must wait a lot of posts about mathematics and physics, but waiting I write an *About* page, waiting the first real post, I share with you [Tenure for Wikipedia](http://johnhawks.net/node/15413) by **John Hawks**. In his post he inserts the following quotation:  

> "I've written articles in many areas, and in many cases I could show my colleagues what I had done in their field," Michel \[Aaij\] says. "I'd like to think that by now most of them have a favorable opinion of Wikipedia. Let's face it: Guillaume de Dole, now a Good Article, there's no database entry or encyclopedic article anywhere that compares to the Wikipedia article on that poem (and I realize that that says as much about Wikipedia as about the anywhere else)."

Why? I'm also a Wikipedian!  
  
P.S.: excuse me for my english... I promise you I'll write better.
