About ten years ago **Giovanni Guido** proposed me a new model to describe particles. Under certain aspects it remembers to me a string model: simplifying as much as possible, Giovanni's model supposes the presence of small quantum oscillators connected to each other by lines that run along a space-time lattice; these lines form geometric figures, golden triangles to be precise, which constitute the geometric structure of particles, elementary and otherwise. I have never had the opportunity to actively work on the model: the commitments in outreach with INAF have always been somehow a priority due to the type of contract that, in some way, pushes me to give priority to these aspects. However, despite everything, we have used his vision to describe a universe that is in a certain sense cyclical that you can find in the following two articles: [_The Universe at Lattice-Fields_](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=80081) and [_Variational Principle in an Expanding Universe_](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=82174).  
Working on Guido's particle model, however, has always been a worry of mine, so a couple of years ago I proposed to him to try to develop a didactic formulation of the model that could be used to bring elementary particles not only to university, but also to high school. From that idea, although my contributions to the writing were minimal, a triptych of articles came out, of which you can find the links below, and which received a particular review that made me very happy:

> The Authors propose a didactic model representative of the particles described of the Standard Model. In this approach, particles result to be geometric forms corresponding to geometric structures of coupled quantum oscillators. An in-depth phenomenology of particles surfaces and this seems fully compatible with that of the Standard Model. Consequently, it is possible to calculate the mass of Higgs's Boson and the mass of the pair "muon and muonic neutrino" in "geometrical" sense. Via this geometric approach, it seems also possible to solve crucial aspects of the Standard Model. as the neutrinosâ€™ oscillations and the intrinsic chirality of the neutrino and antineutrino. The paper is very interesting and deserves immediate publication in JHEPGC.

I don't consider the work finished and indeed I would like to be able to bring these ideas into practice in schools. For now I'm happy to share this happiness here on the blog.
