The first woman known as mathematichian was the italian **Maria Gaetana Agnesi** (1718-1799) and hermost famous work was _Instituzioni analitiche ad uso della gioventÃ¹ italiana_ (_Analytical institutions for italian young people_), in which she studied an old famous curve callde _versiera_, in anglosaxon worlds _the witch of Agnesi_. The name derives from a mistranslation by **John Colson** who intend the original italian therm _averisera_, that means _versed sine curve_, like _avversiera_, that in english became _witch_ or _wife of devil_.  
The curve was studied for the first time by **Pierre de Fermat** in 1630, and after by **Guido Grandi** in 1703 and in 1748 by Maria in her treatise. The curve was defined by:

> Starting with a fixed circle, a point $O$ on the circle is chosen. For any other point $A$ on the circle, the secant line $OA$ is drawn. The point $M$ is diametrically opposite $O$. The line $OA$ intersects the tangent of $M$ at the point $N$. The line parallel to $OM$ through $N$, and the line perpendicular to $OM$ through $A$ intersect at $P$. As the point $A$ is varied, the path of $P$ is the witch.

Its cartesian equation is \\\[y = \\frac{8a^3}{x^2 + 4a^2}\\\] In 1918 **Frederick H. Hodge** proofed that the witch is generated from the following curve \\\[a^2 ( x^2 - 2 (a+k) (2a - y))^2 = k^2x^2 (2ay - y^2)\\\] when $k$ goes to $\\infty$.
