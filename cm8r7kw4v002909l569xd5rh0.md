The physician **Mark Schleupner**, a Ronaoke native, [writes about global warming](http://www.roanoke.com/opinion/schleupner-melting-ice-caps-just-do-the-math/article_e1eec1c2-a9cb-532b-90dd-198040f824d6.html):

> So, according to NASA scientists, if all the ice in 14 million sq km Antarctica melts, sea levels will rise more than 200 feet. Greenland alone has another huge chunk of the Earth’s water tied up in ice; some scientists say that its ice sheet has passed a tipping point and will be gone in the next centuries, raising ocean levels by 24 feet. These are scary amounts of sea level rise that put huge areas of population centers (New York, Boston, Miami, San Francisco, etc.) under water.

Well, it's really interesting, about the climate change, to see the [following Ted-Ed lesson](http://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-quantum-mechanics-explains-global-warming-lieven-scheire):

> You've probably heard that carbon dioxide is warming the Earth. But how exactly is it doing it? Lieven Scheire uses a rainbow, a light bulb and a bit of quantum physics to describe the science behind global warming.
