In the world of black hole researchers, there is a group led by **Tomer Shenar** that, so far, has mostly demonstrated the non-existence of black holes previously announced by other teams.  
As Shenar himself recalled, however,

> For the first time, our group has come together to discuss the discovery of a black hole, instead of eliminating one.

We are talking about [a black hole found inside the Tarantula Nebula](https://www.eso.org/public/unitedkingdom/news/eso2210/?lang), which is part of the Large Magellanic Cloud, one of the satellite galaxies of the Milky Way.  
In particular, this black hole, of stellar mass, is of the "dormant" type, that is, it emits very low levels of X radiation, which are the radiations with which black holes are generally discovered.  
This happens because the black hole interacts very little with its surroundings.  
Another interesting aspect of the discovery is the absence of any trace of the star that generated the black hole.

> \[It\] appears to have completely collapsed, with no sign of a previous explosion.

This black hole, the first extragalactic, was discovered orbiting a massive star thanks to six years of observations at ESO's _Very Large Telescope_.
