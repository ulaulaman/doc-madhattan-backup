The main object of a paper published a couple of days ago on _Science_ is to find an answer to the following question:

> what kind of imaging process could reveal a Bell inequality?

The experimental set-up used a $\\beta$-Barium Borate crystal pumped by a (quasi-cotinuous) laser. The pairs of entagled photons generated are subsequently separated _on a beam splitter and propagate into two distinct optical systems_ like LIGO interferometer.  
The results is the production of some images that shots the Bell inequality violation, like the following image:

> Moreover, our demonstration shows that one can detect the signature of a Bell-type behavior within a single image acquired by an imaging setup. By demonstrating that quantum imaging can generate high-dimensional images illustrating the presence of Bell-type entanglement, we benchmark quantum imaging techniques against the most fundamental test of quantum mechanics.
