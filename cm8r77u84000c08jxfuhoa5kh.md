[T Tauri stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_Tauri_star) are a class of variable stars that are less than about ten million years old. This class is named after the prototype, [T Tauri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_Tauri), a young star in the Taurus star-forming region discovered in October 1852 by **John Russell Hind**. They are found near molecular clouds and identified by their optical variability and strong chromospheric lines. T Tauri stars are pre-main-sequence. In photo you can see 21 T Tauri stars with their protoplanetary disks, rotating circumstellar disks of dense gas and dust. This is probably the beginning of a solar system formation.
