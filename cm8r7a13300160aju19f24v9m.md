The [_Martian Manhunter_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_Manhunter) was created in 1955, at the beginning of the _silver age_ of superheroes, by **Joseph Samachson** and **Joe Certa** on the page of _Detective Comics_ #225. He is a variation on the myth of the [_little green men_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_green_men). The first use of a little gren-skinned extraterrestrial form of life was found by **Chris Aubeck** in the tale _Green Boy From Hurrah_ (1899) and he found the first use of the phrase _little gren man_ referred to martians in the _Daily Kennebec Journal_ (1908). In 1912 in the science fiction novel _A Princess of Mars_, **Edgar Rice Burroughs** described martians about at 10 to 12 feet tall that are not so _little_.  
There's also an astronomical curiosity about the term:

> In 1967, **Jocelyn Bell Burnell** and **Antony Hewish** of the University of Cambridge, UK dubbed the first discovered pulsar LGM-1 for "little green men" because the regular oscillations of its signal suggested a possible intelligent origin. Its designation was later changed to CP 1919, and is now known as PSR B1919+21.

But J'onn is not only green, but also a [shapeshifter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapeshifting). From a biological point of view, this superpower is a bit complex, because J'onn's cells must have [shapeshifter genes](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncb2792) and use a very great number of [shapeshifter proteins](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-disordered-proteins-are-upending-molecular-biology-20170118). There's also the conservation of mass law that create some problems to the shapeshifter, because it must change is shape without change mass: this is a limitation to what kind of shape and object that could be "played" by the shapeshifter.  
But from a technologicaly point of view the problem seems more simple:
