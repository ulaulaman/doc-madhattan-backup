In order to celebrate the anniversary the first observation from x-ray astonomy, the Brera's Astronomical Observatory in Milano organized the international congress _X-ray Astronomy: toward the next 50 years!_  
To the edge of the scientific congress, the organization propose also some public events, starting from the first day, the 1st october, with a talk by the Astronomer Royal, **Martin Rees**.

_From Big Bang to the Biospheres_ is a great journey in the story of the astronomy, _the older science_, starting from **Galileo Galilei**, with the invention of the telescope, and **Isaac Newton**, with the page from [_Principia_](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Newton%27s_Principia_(1846).djvu) about the escape velocity from Earth.

We immediatly jump to the space exploration, with the launch of the _Sputnik_ and the _Time_'s cover dedicated to the first man in space: **Yuri Gagarin**. Of course also a bit homage to the first man on Moon: **Neil Armstrong**.

The exploration of space continued with the satellites mission: the european _Mars Express_, with its spectacular images, and the last Mars' rover, _Curiosity_.  
And after the exploration of **Jupiter**'s satellites (**Io**, **Europa**), it arrives _Cassini_ with its spectacular shots, in particular the [Sun eclipsed by **Saturn**](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Saturn_eclipse.jpg) and the _Huygens_ descending and landing on Titan.

The next step in our research is to find planets beyond our **Solar System**: in order to perform this quest we could use two methods: the _gravitational lens_ and the _transition_.  
Using the first method we found 555 planets, Jupiter- and Saturn-like, but if we want to find Earth-like planets we must use the transition method, and this is the reason of the design and launch of **Kepler mission**.  
Also the exploration with telescope could be most useful for our purpouse. We can use space telescopes, like the famouse **Hubble Space Telescope**, or the Earth telescopes, like the ESO's **Extremely Large Telescope**, that will be the greatest telescope on the planet!  
With the telescopes we can observe a lot of space objects, like supernovae. The first observation of these wonderful explosions [is dued by chinese astronomers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_185), but only with **Fred Hoyle** we have a really powerfull theory about these objects and the [nuclear interactions involving in it](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1960ApJ...132..565H).  
These interstellar explotions are very important in the diffusion of the heavy chemichal elements in the universe, but there are other spectacular interactions like galaxies collisions, that could be described thanks to computer simulations:

But the matter was carried in the universe not only by supernovae but before by the big bang, the graet expansion of the spacetime ... years ago.

Following Rees we could describe our universe using some Escher's illustration: first of all the print _Cubic space division_, that is perfect to describe the anisotropy of the spacetime (or the absence of a privilaged direction)

but _Angel and Devil_ adds also the concept of the expansion.

About our universe theorists have developed a lot of idea starting from quantum mechanics paradoxes, like the many worlds theory or the braneworlds and so on, but the most important challenge for the physics of the future _is the unification between macro and micro_

The journey is concluded on our planet, the Earth, our biosphere, without forgot one of the countless simulation about dark matter:
