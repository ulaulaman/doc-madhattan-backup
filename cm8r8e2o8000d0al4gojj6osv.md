In the last few days I must write the [47th italian Carnival of Mathematics](http://dropseaofulaula.blogspot.com/2012/03/carnevale-della-matematica-47.html) ([Google translation](http://goo.gl/bsKsq)), so I cannot write something about [**Pi Day**](http://www.piday.org/). So, in the end of the day, I try to write a little post about this day.

$\\pi$ is one of the irrational numbers: we cannot write an irrational numbers like a ratio between twointeger numbers, so Pitagora's team called them _irrational_ and hidden their existence. We can define $\\pi$ like the ratio between circle and his diameter, and it's impossible that they are contemporary integer. This assertion was proofed in 1761 by **Johann Heinrich Lambert**, while in 1882 **Ferdinand von Lindemann** proofed that $\\pi$ is a trascendental number, where a trascendental number is a number that we cannot calculate with usual algebric operations.  
In ancient times, the first mathematician who evaluate $\\pi$ was **Archimedes**, who used the method of exhaustion, that is a method to evaluate the area of a shape by inscribing inside it a series of polygons that converge to area's shape. In this way Archimedes find $\\pi = \\frac{211875}{67441} = 3.14163 \\cdots$  
Today we know 5 triolions of digits, thanks to the work of **Shigeru Kondo**, who modify a usual home pc in order to perform the calculations using the softwerdeveloped by **Alexander Yee**. They design an [internet site to describe methods, software and results](http://www.numberworld.org/misc_runs/pi-5t/announce_en.html).  
Following **David Bailey** and **Jonathan Borwein**(1), I find some others interesting site about the calculations of $\\pi$'s digits ([Inverse Symbolic Calculator](http://web.archive.org/web/20041204173054/http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/projects/ISC/), [Electronic Geometry Models](http://www.eg-models.de/)). Other links at [Experimental mathematics](http://www.experimentalmath.info/). But... what is _experimental mathematics_?

> (...) namely the utilization of modern computer technology as an active tool in mathematical research.(1)

For example using the [PSLQ algorithm](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PSLQAlgorithm.html)(2) in 1995 was found the BBP formula for $\\pi$: \\\[\\pi = \\sum\_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{16^k} \\left ( \\frac{4}{8k+1} - \\frac{2}{8k+4} - \\frac{1}{8k+5} - \\frac{1}{8k+6} \\right )\\\]

> This formula permits one to directly calculate binary or hexadecimal digits beginning at the $n$-th digit, without needing to calculate any of the first $n âˆ’ 1$ digits, using a simple scheme that requires very little memory and no multiple-precision arithmetic software.(1)

You can find others BBP formulas in the **David Bailey**'s compendium ([pdf](http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/dhbpapers/bbp-formulas.pdf)).
