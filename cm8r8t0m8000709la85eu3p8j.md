I usually publish abstract's digests on posterous, but in this case I think this is necessary an exception. D0 collaboration at Tevatron, indeed, released two papers on arxiv, and I think that it is important sharing with the much number of readers their work. I startwith _[Search for neutral Higgs bosons decaying to $\\tau$ pairs produced in association with $b$ quarks in $p \\bar{p}$ collisions at $\\sqrt s = 1.96$ TeV](http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.4885)_, shared by [Tommaso](http://www.science20.com/quantum_diaries_survivor/plot_week_mssm_higgs_limits-80391):

> We report results from a search for neutral Higgs bosons produced in association with b quarks using data recorded by the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 7.3 $fb^{-1}$. This production mode can be enhanced in several extensions of the standard model (SM) such as in its minimal supersymmetric extension (MSSM) at high tanBeta. We search for Higgs bosons decaying to tau pairs with one tau decaying to a muon and neutrinos and the other to hadrons. The data are found to be consistent with SM expectations, and we set upper limits on the cross section times branching ratio in the Higgs boson mass range from 90 to 320 $GeV/c^2$. We interpret our result in the MSSM parameter space, excluding tanBeta values down to 25 for Higgs boson masses below 170 $GeV/c^2$.

The other two papers are in [Antimatter Tevatron mystery gains ground](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13988836), a great BBC's article. In particular BBC writes about _[Measurement of the anomalous like-sign dimuon charge asymmetry with 9 $fb^{-1}$ of $p \\bar{p}$ collisions](http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.6308)_:  
  

> We present an updated measurement of the anomalous like-sign dimuon charge asymmetry Aslb for semi-leptonic $b$-hadron decays in 9.0 $fb^-1$ of $p \\bar{p}$ collisions recorded with the D0 detector at a center-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s} = 1.96$ TeV at the Fermilab Tevatron collider. We obtain $Aslb = (-0.787 \\pm 0.172({\\rm stat}) \\pm 0.093 ({\\rm syst}))$. This result differs by 3.9 standard deviations from the prediction of the standard model and provides evidence for anomalously large CP violation in semi-leptonic neutral B decay. The dependence of the asymmetry on the muon impact parameter is consistent with the hypothesis that it originates from semi-leptonic b-hadron decays.

The new data analysis, indeed, is an update of _[Evidence for an anomalous like-sign dimuon charge asymmetry](http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.2757)_:  

> We measure the charge asymmetry $A$ of like-sign dimuon events in 6.1 $fb^{-1}$ of $p\\bar{p}$ collisions recorded with the D0 detector at a center-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{s} = 1.96$ TeV at the Fermilab Tevatron collider. From $A$, we extract the like-sign dimuon charge asymmetry in semileptonic $b$-hadron decays: $Aslb = -0.00957 \\pm 0.00251 ({\\rm stat}) \\pm 0.00146 ({\\rm syst})$. This result differs by 3.2 standard deviations from the standard model prediction $Aslb(SM) = (-2.3^{+0.5}\_{-0.6}) \\times 10^{-4}$ and provides first evidence of anomalous CP-violation in the mixing of neutral $B$ mesons.

I hope to read these papers soon.
