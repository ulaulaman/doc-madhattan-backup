LHCb has [recently observed](http://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/lhcb-public/#JpsiPhiExotics) four new exotic-like particles in the decay of the $B^+$:

> he properties of these structures are consistent with their interpretation as four-quark particles, which are considered as "exotic", (hence the "exotic-like" name in the title), although the details of the four quark $c{\\bar c}s{\\bar s}$ binding mechanism is still under discussion.
