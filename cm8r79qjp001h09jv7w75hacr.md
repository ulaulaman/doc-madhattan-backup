One of the most popular expressions in Italy for giving strength to numbers is _mathematics is not an opinion_. The expression is [exclusively Italian](https://www.ilpost.it/mauriziocodogno/2014/01/04/la-matematica-unopinione-pillole/) and mathematicians don't agree with this opinion, since they have fun inventing a large number of different mathematics. For example, a curious mathematics is what today called _lunar arithmetic_. In this kind of arithmetic, the sum between two digits gives the largest digit, while the product between two digits gives the smallest one. A particular consequence of the multiplication rule is the definition of prime numbers: in base 10 a _lunar prime number_ is a number divisible only by itself and by 9, because the neutral element of _lunar multiplication_ is 9.
