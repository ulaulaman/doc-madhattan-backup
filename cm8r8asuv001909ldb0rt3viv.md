_Les Horribles Cernettes_ is a rock-swing group that started its activity with the... [birth of the web](http://docmadhattan.fieldofscience.com/2011/11/birth-of-web.html)!  
Indeed [the first photo uploaded on web by **Tim Berners-Lee**](http://motherboard.vice.com/2012/7/10/crossdressing-compression-and-colliders-the-first-photo-on-the-web) was a promotional photoshop by the _fab four girl from LHC_!

The group is, today, formed by three girls **Michele de Gennaro**, **Anne MacNabb**, **Colette Marx-Nielsen**, and this is the original story from the [official web site](http://musiclub.web.cern.ch/MusiClub/bands/cernettes/press_info.html):

> Once upon a summer there was a girl. She was a CERN secretary tired of waiting day and night for her permanently-on-shift physicist boyfriend, and so she decided to attract his attention by stepping on stage during the CERN Hardronic Festival to sing about her lonely nights in front of the entire CERN population. She asked Silvano \[de Gennaro, an IT developer who worked with Tim Berners-Lee\] to write a song about her life and a couple of girlfriends to back her up on stage. A few weeks later the Cernettes were on stage for the first time, for the delight of thousands of happy Physicists, singing Collider, the song that since that day became the National Anthem of the High Energy Kingdom.

Their first success was _Liquid Nitrogen_, but today I would share a live version of _Mr. Higgs_:

But _Les Cernettes_ are nearest to [_say goodbye_](http://musiclub.web.cern.ch/MusiClub/bands/cernettes/goodbye.html): indeed their last live will be on 21st July at the [2012 Hardronic Music Festival](http://muzipod.free.fr/?p=70). So, if you are in the zone, go to the Fest in order to see _Les Cernettes_!

A curious news that it could be connected with _Les Cernettes_ is the sonification of ATLAS' data by **Domenico Vicinanza** in collaboration with **Mariapaola Sorrentino** and **Giuseppe La Rocca**:
