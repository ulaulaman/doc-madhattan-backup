_Proxima Centauri_ is a red dwarf located approximately 4.2 light years from us, in the area of ​​sky covered by the Centaur constellation. Thanks to ESO's telescopes, in particular to the [HARPS spectrograph](http://www.eso.org/instruments/harps/), and using the Doppler (or radial velocity) method, in 2016 it was anounced [the discovery of a planet around this star](https://www.eso.org/public/unitedkingdom/news/eso1629/?lang), _Proxima Centauri b_.  
Given the proximity, one might think that the world of comics has devoted much attention in recent years to the star and its planet. In fact, to have a comic set around this star, you have to wait until the second half of 2018 when Image Comics publishes the six-issue miniseries _Proxima Centauri_ by **Farel Dalrymple**.  
The work, subsequently collected in volume in January 2019, **is halfway between science fiction and fantasy**. The main character is Sherwood Breadcoat, a teenage magician trapped on an artificial spheroid called _Proxima Centauri_, evidently put in orbit around the homonymous star. Of course, this information is not very clear, but overall the whole Dalrymple comic is rather lack of information, closed in a hermetic narration with an open ending that allows the author keep some subplots open, like the relationship between Sherwood and the scientist, that sometimes seems help the teen, other times usi it for his purposes; or as one of Sherwood's opponents, which is actually a sort of virtual, but also physical manifestation of a character hidden somewhere on the spheroid and who seems to be a videogame player, given that he explicitly states that he wants to repeat the vlash with Sherwood, although it ended badly more than once.  
In all this, although science would seem to play a fundamental role, at least according to some lines of Breadcoat, a character who believes only in science and magic (?), it is a simple narrative accessory, a way to not deepen the technology used or to hide all the magical aspects of the story, only apparently sci-fi.  
In any case, Dalrymple's comic is good to remember that, quite recently, a team of Italian astronomers, studying the data coming from Proxima Centauri with more accuracy, [has supposed the existence of a second planet around the star](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-second-planet-may-orbit-earths-nearest-neighboring-star/), roughly six times more massive than Earth. We will see if it will be confirmed or not.
