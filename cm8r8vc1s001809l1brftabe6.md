Dear Mr Filippelli,  
  
I've just read your article which ideas I completely share and support.  
With this I want to inform you and Mr. Stewart that the new mathematics solving some of the problems mentioned in the article one can find in my papers:  
Management Studies (2020), 8(3), 191-214,  
http://www.davidpublisher.org/index.php/Home/Article/index?id=43867.html  
ACRN-JOFRP, (2020), 9, 148-176; http://www.acrn-journals.eu/resources/jofrp09l.pdf  
Management Studies (2020), 8(6), 430-452,  
http://www.davidpublisher.org/index.php/Home/Article/index?id=44856.html  
  
The main message of these papers is that financial economics in its present form is now completing the period of its development which founded on the works of Kendall (53), Onsager (59), Modigliani & Miller (58-63), Black & Scholes (73), Merton (74), Harrison (80), Leland (94), and their multiple followers. I have shown that Modigliani-Miller Propositions, Merton's real options, the risk-neutral probabilities, and the no-arbitrage pricing principle are generally wrong. Their deficiencies follow from the use of the oversimplified Geometric Brownian model (GBM) introduced by Black & Scholes and ignoring the firm's compulsory payments, such as fixed costs, debt payments, taxes, and dividends. Detailed criticism of the traditional theories one can find in my papers. No attempt rejecting my approach and defending the traditional theories by proving their soundness mathematically has been made so far.  
Could you please resend this message to Ian Stewart for more professional discussion?  
  
Sincerely yours,  
Valery Shemetov
