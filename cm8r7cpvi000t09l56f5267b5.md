In 1644 the Italian mathematician **Pietro Mengoli** proposed the so-called _Basel's problem_, which asked for the exact solution to the square of the sum of the reciprocals of all the natural numbers: \\\[\\sum\_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} = \\frac{1}{1^2} + \\frac{1}{2^2} + \\cdots\\\] The solution to the problem came in 1735 thanks to **Leonard Euler**, at the time at the beginning of his brilliant career as a problem solver. The Swiss mathematician proved that the exact sum of the series is $\\pi^2 / 6$.  
The Euler's demonstration, published in its final form in 1741, is particularly interesting: Euler supposed that it's possible to apply the rules of the finite polynomials even those endless.  
We start with the development in Taylor series for the sine function in 0: \\\[\\sin(x) = x - \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\frac{x^5}{5!} - \\frac{x^7}{7!} + \\cdots\\\] Dividing by $x$ both terms, we obtain: \\\[\\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} = 1 - \\frac{x^2}{3!} + \\frac{x^4}{5!} - \\frac{x^6}{7!} + \\cdots\\\] whose roots are $\\pi$, $-\\pi$, $2\\pi$, $-2\\pi$, $3\\pi$, $-3\\pi$, $\\ldots$ By changing the variable as $z = x^2$, the polynomial above becomes: \\\[\\frac{\\sin(\\sqrt{z})}{\\sqrt{z}} = 1 - \\frac{z}{3!} + \\frac{z^2}{5!} - \\frac{z^3}{7!} + \\cdots\\\] whose roots are $\\pi^2$, $4\\pi^2$, $9\\pi^2$, $\\ldots$  
Now, given a polynomial $a\_n x^n + \\cdots + a\_3 x^3 + a\_2 x^2 + bx + 1$, for the _formulas of Vi√®te_, we have that the sum of the reciprocals of its roots has as result $-b$. Applying this result for finished polynomials to infinite polynomial in $z$ above, we get: \\\[\\frac{1}{3!} = \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{\\pi^2} + \\frac{1}{4\\pi^2} + \\frac{1}{9\\pi^2} + \\frac{1}{16\\pi^2} + \\cdots\\\] and so: \\\[\\frac{\\pi^2}{6} = 1 + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{16} + \\cdots = \\sum\_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2}\\\] It's simple to observe the connection between Mengoli's series and Riemann's zeta \\\[\\zeta(s) = \\sum\_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^s}\\\] with $s=2$.  
Last observation: in 1982 on the magazine _Eureka_, it appeared a rigorous proof of Euler's result signed by **John Scholes**, although it seems that such a demonstration circulated already to late sixties between Cambridge corridors.
