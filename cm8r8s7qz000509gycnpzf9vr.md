This beautiful shot (via [Universe Today](http://www.universetoday.com/88686/astrophoto-cygnus-constellation-by-marco-t/)) is the Cygnus Constellation. The photographer is **Marco T.**, italian, and you can see others great photos on [his flickr account](http://www.flickr.com/photos/marcopics3000/).  
But this beautiful shot is the better introduction to _Earlth and Moonch_, a animated short by **Dei Gaztelumendi** I see the short in Italy, during the [Milano Film Festival](http://www.milanofilmfestival.it/portal/2011/IT/programma_db/rassegna.php?cr=4), and in the worlds of Gaztelumendi is a reflession about Earth, ecology and our future.
