There are some interesting news about the research of exoplanets, but the first step starting from our planet, the Earth. Indeed, **Evelyn Macdonald** and **Nicolas Cowan** used the satellite Scicast to detect the transit spectrum of our planet. The idea is to deduce the atmosphere composition, obtaining the Earth's organic signature, and in this way data to confront with exoplanets transit spectrum.

About two weeks after the pubblication of the previous paper, an international team of astronomers have discovered water vapor in the atmosphere of K2-18 b, an exoplanet that orbit in the habitable zone of the red dwarf K2-18. While it was initially considered a [mini-Neptune on its 2015 discovery](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/809/1/25), the improved data on K2-18b has [classified it as a super-Earth](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/187), although its size and density make it unlikely to be composed entirely of rocky iron and silicates.
