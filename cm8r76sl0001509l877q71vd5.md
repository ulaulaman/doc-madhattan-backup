Evaluating [_Beneficio_](http://www.europecomics.com/album/beneficio/) is by no means trivial. The narrative is all concentrated around a woman in search of herself, remembering her missing grandmother.  
There is not only this, however. The protagonist's journey takes her to [Beneficio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beneficio), a valley near the Spanish village of Orgiva where there is a community that lives in contact with nature in self-built tents, tepees and shelters.  
In this environment the woman begins to reflect on her life and then passes, without any solution of continuity, to the universe and the divine, mixing fantastic, almost religious ideas, with the great scientific questions still unanswered. All within a valley surrounded by large mountains, wild and peaceful.  
The narrative itself fits the theme: the story is diluted and rarefied, the pages with the minimum number of vignettes (rarely more than three or four), while the drawings now look like travel sketches, at other times particularly detailed.  
Overall, both from a narrative and an aesthetic point of view, _Beneficio_ by **Micha≈Ç Kalicki** and **Krzysztof Gawronkiewicz** is almost a land version of **Daisuke Igarashi**'s _Children of the sea_.
