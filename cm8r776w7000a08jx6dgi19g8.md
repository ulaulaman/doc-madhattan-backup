The comic transposition of **Isaac Asimov**'s _I, robot_ created by **Raul Cuadrado** is reminiscent of the first flash animations of a decade ago, a bit like the style of **Carlos Meglia**, famous in particular for _Cybersix_. Made on a horizontal rather than vertical page structure reminiscent of newspaper strip stories, the comic book [_I, robot_](http://www.europecomics.com/album/i-robot/) is a quick and intelligent reading, with a slightly retro style thanks to the duotone, true to Asimov's spirit.
