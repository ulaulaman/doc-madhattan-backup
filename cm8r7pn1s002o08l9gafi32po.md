In Paolo Sarpi, a street of Milano, there is a street artist who sketches a lot of subject (for example [Iron Man](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ulaulaman/9842374244/) or [this iconic space monkey](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ulaulaman/9842395905/)). In particular today I find a beautiful reproduction of the most famous photograph about Albert Einstein:

> On Einstein's 72nd birthday on March 14, 1951, UPI photographer Arthur Sasse was trying to persuade him to smile for the camera, but having smiled for photographers many times that day, Einstein stuck out his tongue instead. This photograph became one of the most popular ever taken of Einstein, often used in merchandise depicting him in a lighthearted sense. Einstein enjoyed this photo and requested UPI to give him nine copies for personal use, one of which he signed for a reporter.

_Sulmondo_, the nick of the street artists, add only one little detail to the original photo!
