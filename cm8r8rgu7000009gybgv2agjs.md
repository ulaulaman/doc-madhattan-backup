The [Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2011](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2011/press.html) is assigned to **Daniel Shechtman**

> for the discovery of quasicrystals

The paper of the discover, written with **Blech**, **Gratias** and **Cahn**, starting with the following worlds:

> We report herein the existence of a metallic solid which diffracts electrons like a single crystal but has point group symmetry $m \\bar{35}$ (icosahedral) which is inconsistent with lattice translations.(2)

Indeed in 1992 the definition of crystals given by the International Union of Crystallography was:

> A crystal is a substance in which the constituent atoms, molecules, or ions are packed in a regularly ordered, repeating three-dimensional pattern.

So the discover of Shechtman and collegues was very important: they introduce a new class of crystals, named [quasicrystals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasicrystal "quasicrystal Wikipedia") by **Levine** and **Steinhardt** some weeks later(3), and a new way to view [crystals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal "crystal Wikipedia").  
In particular Shechtman, studying Al with 10–14% Mn, and collegues observed that

> The symmetries of the crystals dictate that several icosahedra in a unit cell havedifferent orientations and allow them to be distorted (...)(2)

And when they observe crystal using lattice translations:

> crystals cannot and do not exhibit the icosahedral point group symmetry.(2)

They also oserve that the formation of the icosahedral phase is a transition phase of the first order, because the two phases (the other is translational) coexist for a while during translation(2).

And it's interesting to notice that Penrose tilings are related to _golden ratio_, that defines the coordinate system of an icosahedron.  
Indeed we can define the coordinate system of the solid in the following way(4): \\\[(\\pm u, \\pm v, 0); \\; (0, \\pm u, \\pm v); \\; (\\pm v, 0, \\pm u)\\\] where \\\[\\frac{v}{u} = \\tau - 1\\\] with $\\tau$ golden ratio.  
So the elements of the icosahedral point groups are the [symmetry transformations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icosahedral_symmetry "icosahedral symmetry Wikipedia") that permutate icosahedral vertices. With this _definition_, we can distinguish between two different icosahedral gruop, $235 \[I\]$ that contains all rotations _which leave the icosahedron invariant_, and $2/M \\bar{35} \[I\_h\]$, the group of Al with 10–14% Mn, that contains 120 elements.

> This group is the direct product of the icosahedral group $235 \[I\]$ and the group consisting of the identity and spatial inversion.(4)

The four generators of the group can be represented with the following matrices: \\\[D \[2 (12)\] = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\\] \\\[D \[3 (143)\] = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\\] \\\[D \[5 (1-12)\] = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.5 & -0.5 \\tau & \\frac{0.5}{\\tau} \\\\ 0.5 \\tau & \\frac{0.5}{\\tau} & -0.5 \\\\ \\frac{0.5}{\\tau} & 0.5 & 0.5 \\tau \\end{pmatrix}\\\] \\\[D \[\\bar{1}\] = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\\]
