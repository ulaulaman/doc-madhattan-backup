Using the digits 1,2,... in base k expansion is well-known and not new. The earliest reference I know is Salomaa's book Formal Languages (pp. 90-91) in 1973, although it is probably much older. Other references include Forslund, A logical alternative to the existing positional number system, Southwest J. Pure Appl. Math. 1 (1995), 27-29 and Boute, Zeroless positional number representation and string ordering, Amer. Math. Monthly 107 (2000), 437-444.
