Some days ago, [ATLAS has been released a draft](http://cds.cern.ch/record/1542341) about the spin of [the new boson](http://docmadhattan.fieldofscience.com/2012/07/discovering-boson.html). The decay channels studied are the _fab four_: $H \\rightarrow \\gamma \\gamma$, $H \\rightarrow WW^\*$, $H \\rightarrow l\\nu l\\nu$, $H \\rightarrow ZZ^\* \\rightarrow 4l$. The idea is combining data from the four channels in order to understand the spin of the new boson, in detail to distinguish between two cases: spin 0 ($J^P = 0^+$), and so a boson compatible with the Standard Model, and spin 2 ($J^P = 2^+$), that it could be connected with [a model](http://prd.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v81/i7/e075022) ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.3396)) that represents a light coupling between the Standard Model's fields and the hypothetical graviton.  
These the ATLAS' conclusions:

> The data are in good agreement with the expected distributions of a $J^P=0^+$ particle while the graviton-inspired $J^P=2^+$ model, that is expected to be produced dominantly via the gluon fusion process, is excluded at more than 99.9% conÔ¨Ådence level.

We could say that it starting the _elimination process_ of the models that would lead the research of the _new physics_ beyond the Standard Model for the next years. A good luck to all of them, but we don't forget the key role of the Standard Model, that is in some sense confirmed by this last draft from ATLAS.
