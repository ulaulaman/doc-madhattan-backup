[Neutrinos](http://docmadhattan.fieldofscience.com/2015/10/a-brief-history-of-neutrinos.html) are the most light particles in the universe, but we don't know your mass. In the current state of the research, the only thing that we can hope to do is find upper and lower limits. And in the previous weeks we have some interesting news about the upper limit.  
In april _Physics Review Letters_ published a paper in which a team of researcher have compared _constraints from physically motivated neutrino mass models (i.e., ones respecting oscillation experiments) to those from models using standard cosmological approximations_. They founded an upper limit about $0.26 \\, eV$, almost 2 million times lighter than an electron.

Upper Bound of Neutrino Masses from Combined Cosmological Observations and Particle Physics Experiments. Physical review letters, 123(8), 081301. doi:[10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.081301](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.081301) ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02578)

In the meanwhile, just ten days ago, the KATRIN's team (KATRIN, _Karlsruhe Trtitium Neutrino experiment_) announced the new experimental upper limit: $1.1 \\, eV$.

The research of neutrino mass becomes more and more interesting: if the study of theoretical models combined with astronomical data gives us an idea of the range to look for, experiments will say the last word.  
The hunt to the neutrino is still open!
