> The standard axioms of quantum mechanics imply that in the limit of continuous observation a quantum system cannot evolve.  
> (**Andrew Hodges** in _Alan Turing: the logical and physical basis of computing_ - [pdf](http://www.bcs.org/upload/pdf/ewic_tur04_paper1.pdf))

Initially known as _Turing’s paradox_, in honor of the mathematician who formulated it in the 1950s, was subsequently identified as [_quantum Zeno effect_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Zeno_effect), resulting an advanced version of the famous _Zeno’s arrow paradox_, whose phylosophical result is the negation of motion. A first formulation and derivation of the effect is found in _Does the lifetime of an unstable system depend on the measuring apparatus?_([1](#fn1)), while **George Sudarshan** and **Baidyanath Misra** were the first to identify it as quantum Zeno paradox. The two theoretical physicists established that _an unstable particle will not decay as long as it is kept under continuous observation_([2](#fn2)). However they try to save _goat and cabbage_:

> There is a fundamental principle in quantum theory that denies the possibility of continuous observation.([2](#fn2))

On the other hand, **Ghirardi**, **Omero**, **Weber** and **Rimini** show that:

> if the uncertainty relations are properly taken into account the arguments leading to the paradox are not valid.([3](#fn3))

The key role in the demonstration of Ghirardi _et al._ is the time and energy reformulation of the Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle([4](#fn4)): \\\[\\Delta H \\cdot \\Delta T \\leq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\\] If we want measure more frequently (up to the continuous), we nust necessarily reduce the time for the measure itself, and this leads to larger energies([3](#fn3)).  
These objections, however, didn’t prevent the theorists to speculate about this quantum formulation of the arrow paradox: **Richard Cook**, for example, suggested an experiment([5](#fn5)) that should demonstrate the reality of the paradox. The experiment, which involved the capture of an ion, was actually carried out in 1989 by NIST([6](#fn6)) using about 5000 ions of $^9 Be^+$ and thus demonstrating the reality of the effect:

Transition $2 \\rightarrow 1$

The results, as always in science, instead of ending the story, have opened new issues (also for the opposite effect, the quantum anti-Zeno effect, where continuous observation generates a probability of 1). Certainly there is to understand the link between the quantum Zeno effect and Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle for time and energy.  
Another issue is to understand the validity of the effect: the paradox provides the possibility of instantaneous measurements, which is practically impossible. It is therefore necessary to understand the experimental conditions for which the effect should be presented: it is the target of the very logn paper by **Koshino** and **Shimizu**. They use quantum theory of measure to clarify a paradox that seems an effect([7](#fn7)).  
One of the most recently result about the quantum Zeno paradox is dued by **Paolo Facchi** and **Marilena Ligabò**, that studied the effect over long periods([8](#fn8)). In particular, they focused on the mathematical behavior of the quantum probability $p^{(N)} (t)$, when both the time $t$ and the number of measurements $N$ go to infinity.  
The two researchers have observed that the value of $p$ depends on a real parameter $\\alpha$: for $0 \\leq \\alpha \\leq 1/2$, _the system is frozen in its initial state and the QZE takes place_; for $1/2 < \\alpha < 1$, the system has a classic behavior; for $\\alpha = 1/2$, the probability has a gaussian behavior, $e{-t2 / \\tau^2}$, where $\\tau \\propto \\hbar^{-2}$.  
Finally

> if $\\alpha \\geq 1$ the limit probability is a strange beast and becomes sensitive to the spectral properties of the state $\\psi$([8](#fn8))

From a physical point of view, this fact complicates the situation and makes necessary further analysis. However, it is interesting to note that this effect may also have a long-term effect on quantum systems.  
However, beyond the physical and philosophical arguments, it is very interesting to observe how the quantum Zeno effect seems to be a perfect counterbalance of [adiabatic invariants](http://docmadhattan.fieldofscience.com/2017/06/adiabatic-pendulum.html), where non-observations play a key role: it seems that the two theorems counterbalance each other to create a perfect equilibrium within which any imperfect physical system evolves.
