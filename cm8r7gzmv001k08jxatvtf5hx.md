[**Inge Lehmann**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inge_Lehmann) was a Danish seismologist and geophysicist. Using seismic data, she discovered the inner _solid_ core of the Earth with some physical properties distinct from the outer _liquid_ core:

> No rays emerged at epicentral distances between 112° and 154°. I then placed a smaller core inside the first core and let the velocity in it be larger so that a reflection would occur when the rays through the larger core met it. After a choice of velocities in the inner core was made, a time curve was obtained, part of which appeared in the interval where there had not been any rays before. The existence of a small solid core in the innermost part of the earth was seen to result in waves emerging at distances where it had not been possible to predict their presence.
