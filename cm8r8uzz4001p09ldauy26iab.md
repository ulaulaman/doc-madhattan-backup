Dear Gianluigi, congratulations for your nice post. Concerning your last question, I'm currently working on some models of morphogenesis (formation of neuromasts in zebra fishes) and my partial conclusion is that the real mechanisms are much more complicated of those described by a simple reaction-diffusion mechanism. In particular, cells are moving with a finite speed of propagations, and micro- and macro- considerations have to be taken into account and merged to produce realistic predictions. Nevertheless, it is always surprising to find the great effectiveness of the Turing's idea.
