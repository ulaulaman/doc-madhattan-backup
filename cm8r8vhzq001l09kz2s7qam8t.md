This is pretty neat- but Kepler 16b is cold and gaseous. If it harbors any form of life, it cannot lifeforms we are accustomed too. Maybe it has moons similar to Europa that could have liquid oceans beneath their icy surface- but any forms of life their would never see the double stars. They would live in the inky blackness of a deep extrasolar sea, having only the flashing lights of strange deep-sea creatures to navigate by.  
  
I have a question for any astrophysics nerds reading this- is it possible for a planet to have a stable orbit in the habitable zone of the Kepler 16 system, or any other binary system? If it is, perhaps someday a human astronaut will see double suns in the sky of an alien world.
