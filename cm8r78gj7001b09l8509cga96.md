Comet Atlas, portrait by **Tim Connolly**

First of all I start from Atlas, a new comet that is coming here! It will arrive at the end of May, passing only 0.25 AU from the sun. It could be a good opportunity for amateurs to observe a new object in the sky, but there is a not so reassuring news:

This is not the only bad news: the first insterstellar comet, 2I/Borisov, that it goes away from the Sun with a speed of about 17 km/s (it will reach a speed of 32 m/s), seems to have lost a piece of the core ([ATel #13611](http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=13611), [ATel #13613](http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=13613)).
