**Felix Klein** was a German mathematician best known for a particularsurface thet he introduced in 18882: the [Klein bottle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_bottle), a non-orientable surface without edge, inside, outside and no boundary (for example a sphere is an orientable surface without boundaries).

> In 1995 **Alan Bennett**, a retired glass-blower, became interested in Klein bottles and was in a unique position to satisfy his curiosity. From simple beginnings his researches produced a variety of beautiful and mathematically sophisticated forms. New discoveries have emerged from his work which formed the inspiration for this display.

> This is one of a series of glass Klein bottles made by \[the artist\] for the Science Museum. It consists of three Klein bottles, one inside another. In the series Alan Bennett made Klein bottles analogous to Mobius strips with odd numbers of twists greater than one.
