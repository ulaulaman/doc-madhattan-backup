If you are a reader of the *Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy*, you probably know that 42 is the answer to the *Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything*. The choice of the number by **Douglas Adams** was quite random, excluding the simple fact that the number liked the writer. Yet the 42 was the protagonist of a recent news related to [one of the open problems of mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sums_of_three_cubes):

> Is there a number that is not 4 or 5 modulo 9 and that cannot be expressed as a sum of three cubes?

To find an answer to this question, mathematicians used numerical methods. In particular, **Andreas-Stephan Elsenhans** and **Jorg Jahnel** (2) using a [particular vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_reduction) (1), searched solutions of the following diophantine equation:

$$x^3+y^3+z^3=n$$

for \\(n \leq 1000\\) with \\(\max (|x|,|y|,|z|) < 10^{14}\\). This method was later developed by **Sander Husiman** (3) to \\(\max (|x|,|y|,|z|) < 10^{15}\\). In the end all numbers, except for 33 and 42, below 100 that are not 4 or 5 module 9 have solutions.

The cubic decomposition of these two numbers come in 2019. In both cases, the protagonist was **Andrew Booker**. [In the case of 33](https://aperiodical.com/2019/03/33-can-be-written-as-the-sum-of-three-cubes/) the solution arrives in march:

$$\begin{array}{c} (-80538738812075974)^3 \, + \, (-8778405442862239)^3 \, + \\+ \, (-2736111468807040)^3 = 33\end{array}$$

It's interesting to observe that Booker, in abstract, write that he was inspired by a *Numperphile*'s youtube video:

The solution for 42 [arrived at the beginning of september](https://aperiodical.com/2019/09/42-is-the-answer-to-the-question-what-is-80538738812075974%C2%B3-80435758145817515%C2%B3-12602123297335631%C2%B3/):

$$\begin{array}{c} (8866128975287528)^3 \, + \, (80435758145817515)^3 \, + \\+ \, (12602123297335631)^3 = 42\end{array}$$

In this case Booker obtains his result in collaboration with **Andrew Sutherland**: in this way the list of all numbers less than 100 that are not 4 or 5 module 9 is completed.

Now, in the list of numbers between 100 and 1000, the numbers without a cubic decomposition are: 114, 165, 390, 579, 627, 633, 732, 921, e 975.
