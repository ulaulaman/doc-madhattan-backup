The choice of the number by **Douglas Adams** was quite random, excluding the simple fact that the number liked the writer. Yet the 42 was the protagonist of a recent news related to [one of the open problems of mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sums_of_three_cubes):

> Is there a number that is not 4 or 5 modulo 9 and that cannot be expressed as a sum of three cubes?

To find an answer to this question, mathematicians used numerical methods. In particular, **Andreas-Stephan Elsenhans** and **Jorg Jahnel** using a [particular vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_reduction), searched solutions of the following diophantine equation:
