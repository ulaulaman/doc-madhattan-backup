**How do we spill coffee?**

> (a) Either by accelerating too much for a given coffee level (fluid statics)  
> (b) Or, through more complicated dynamical phenomena:
> 
> *   Initial acceleration sets an initial sloshing amplitude, which is analogous to the main antisymmetric mode of sloshing.
> *   This initial perturbation is amplified by the back-and-forth and pitching excitations since their frequency is close to the natural one because of the choice of normal mug dimensions.
> *   Vertical motion also does not lead to resonance as it is a subharmonic excitation (Faraday phenomena).
> *   Noise has higher frequency, which makes the antisymmetric mode unstable thus generating a swirl.
> *   Time to spill depends on "focused"/"unfocused" regime and increases with decreasing maximum acceleration (walking speed).

**How can we prevent spilling?**

> Lessons learned from sloshing dynamics may suggest strategies to control spilling, e.g. via using
> 
> *   a flexible container to act as a sloshing absorber in suppressing liquid oscillations.
> *   a series of concentric rings (baffles) arranged around the inner wall of a container.
