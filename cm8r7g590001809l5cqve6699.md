> [**John Philipps Emslie**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Philipps_Emslie) (1839â€“1913) was a British topographical artist and folklorist.  
> From 1854, Emslie studied at _The Working Men's College_, and was a student of **Dante Gabriel Rossetti**. He became a topographical artist, and illustrated [_The Illustrated topical record of London_](https://archive.org/details/illustratedtopo00londgoog) vol. 9. in 1900. He wrote and illustrated the [_New Canterbury Tales_](https://archive.org/details/newcanterburytal00emsl) (Griffith, Farran, Okeden & Welsh) ca.1887.  
> Emslie was an original member of The Folklore Society and was a council member for that Society. He gathered local folklore from around England, making notes and topographical drawings.

He also realized a lot of scientific illustration, something like the modern infographics. For example the map of the Moon (via [core77](http://www.core77.com/posts/27138/Throwback-Thursday-The-First-Infographics-On-the-Moon)) at the beginning of the post. The caption of the map was a quotation by [**William Scoresby**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Scoresby) about his observation of the Moon at the Lord Rosse's telescope [between 1847-48](http://www.bradfordhistorical.org.uk/rosse.html):

> It appeared like a Globe of Molten Silver, and every object of the extent of a hundred yards was quite visible. Edifices, therefore of the size of York Minster might be early perceived if they had existed. But there was no appearance of anything of that nature neither was there any in diction of the existence of water or of an atmosphere. There was a vast number of extinct volcanoes, several miles in the breadth through one of them there was a line in continuance of one about 160 miles in length, which ran in a straight direction on like a railway. The general appearance however was like one vast ruin of nature.
