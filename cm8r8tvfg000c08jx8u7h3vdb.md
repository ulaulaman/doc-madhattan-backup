DAMA mission's logo is designed by an italian middle school student, and mission name is choiced by another young pupil using the first two letters ofthe words *dark matter*.  
The mission man is **Roberto Vittori**: he'll use AMS-02. Using this device, he will detect dark matter *and antimatter by observing the cosmic rays, helping us hopefully to better understand the origin and structure of the Universe*.  
Roberto will act also some experiments in life science, technology, medicine, biology and material science.

From [ESA's pdf](http://esamultimedia.esa.int/hsf/DAMA/DAMA_Information_kit_en_web.pdf) I extract some quotes about AMS:

> AMS is embarking on a mission to explore distant and  
> uncharted realms of our Universe, where answers to some longstanding questions in particle physics and cosmology may be revealed and unexpected phenomena may be discovered.

Mission's keywords are *cosmic rays*, *antimatter*, *dark matter*, *dark energy*.  
Cosmic rays are composed by radiation and stable particles from stars, but when they arrive to our planet, they interact with atmosphere. So it is need to use a detector in space, and *astronomers and particle physicists are eagerly awaiting the data*.  
Antimatter is, in a very simple picture, same to the matter but with opposed charge, and is more unstable.

> AMS will search for antimatter to the edge of the observable universe.

Finally, according to theories and indirect observations, we know to... unknow 95% of the universe! Experiment was projected by prof.Ting.

> Prof. Ting's experiment will increase the sensitivity of the search by between a thousand and a million times, revealing a totally different domain by either finding the neutralino or revealing something else. AMS-02 might also detect a new, exotic form of matter predicted by scientists: a very heavy elementary particle dubbed 'strangelet'.

Another important event is the presence on International Space Station of two italians, Roberto Vittori, who arrived with STS-134 mission. And on ISS there is **Paolo Nespoli**, who publishes his spectacular photos on [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/magisstra/).  
A great event for all Italian poeple!
