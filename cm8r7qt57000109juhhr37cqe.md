Today is the american Fibonacci's day, so it could be a good day to write something about one of the last work by [**Alan Turing**](https://docmadhattan.hashnode.dev/turing-patterns-in-coats-and-sounds).

> One of a number of problems \[Alan Turing\] was trying to solve was the appearence of Fibonacci numbers in the structure of plants.(1)

The problem was knwon as the *Fibonacci phyllotaxis*, and we can state it in [this way](http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v8/n12/full/nphys2512.html):

> the spiral shapes on the heads of sunflowers seemed to follow the Fibonacci sequence, prompting \[Turing's\] proposal that by studying sunflowers we might better understand how plants grow

Turing wrote his interest in a letter to the zoologist **JZ Young**:

About the point (iii) Turing wrote in another letter:

> Our new machine is to start arriving on Monday. I am hoping to do something about 'chemical embyology'. In particular I think I can account for the appearence of Fibonacci numbers in connection with fir-cones.<sup>(1)</sup>

The last year **Jonathan Swinton**, during the Manchester Science Festival in October, announced the [results](http://www.turingsunflowers.com/results/) of the great experiment about the Turing's sunflower:

An happy Fibonacci's day!
