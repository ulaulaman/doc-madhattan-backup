Some days ago [Nasa published the following incredible photo](http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_2077.html):

It is an infrared mosaic produced using Hubble's shots and represent the Universe observed by the space telescope. But also from Earth we can observe some spectacular images, like the stars in the sky or the Milky Way. [Thursday](http://docmadhattan.fieldofscience.com/2011/10/milky-way-in-timelapse.html) we see a greattimelapse from **Jared Brandon** and today I propose you another great timelapse, realized by [**Randy Halverson**](http://vimeo.com/dakotalapse) (via [Universe Today](http://www.universetoday.com/88387/stunning-new-timelapse-milky-way-tempest/)):

I think it could represent the perfect fusion between Earth and Sky, like in this shots from the [slideshow of the video](http://dakotalapse.com/?p=448):
