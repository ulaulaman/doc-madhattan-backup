The primordial universe continues to reveal its mysteries to us: a research group led by **Christina Williams** from the _Steward Observatory_ of the University of the Arizona, using the 66 antennas that constitute the [ALMA radiotelescope](https://www.eso.org/public/italy/teles-instr/alma/) in Chile, has revealed a weak emission in radio frequencies, probably dued to the dust generated by stellar formation inside a giant primordial galaxy, about 12.5 billion years away from us, just more than a billion year after the initial expansion of the spacetime (the _Big Bang_).
