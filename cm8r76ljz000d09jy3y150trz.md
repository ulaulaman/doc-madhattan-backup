The tradition of horror stories is full of hooded characters, but the great success of creepy pasta, short stories, but also animations and illustrations spread online, has led to the success of a particularly disturbing character, **Eric Knudsen**'s _Slender Man_. And the above shot taken by the _Hubble Space Telescope_ on June 19, 2019 is somewhat reminiscent of that disturbing kidnapper of children. From an astronomical point of view, the image captured a particularly advanced collision of two galaxies.  
But as a fan of superhero comics I find that also Mr. Bloom, a Batman's villain recently introduced (2015), could be a very good _alter ego_ of [Arp-Madore 2026-424](https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic1919a/).
