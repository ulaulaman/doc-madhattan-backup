Some days ago I write [a little tumblrpost](http://ulaulaman.tumblr.com/post/16524929135/the-gyromodel-of-life-in-the-image-there-is-the) about [_Theory of the Origin, Evolution, and Nature of Life_](http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/life2010001) by **Erik D. Andrulis**. In that occasion I expressed my skepticism comparing Andrulis' theory with string theory. Today I would report [a post written by **John Timmer**](http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2012/01/how-the-craziest-fing-theory-of-everything-got-published-and-promoted.ars), that is more detailed, but he starts writing:

> Physicists have been working for decades on a "theory of everything," one that unites quantum mechanics and relativity. Apparently, they were being too modest.

But for me the most important quote is the following:

> Peer review isn't meant as a way to censor unpopular or radically new ideas. It is meant to ensure that publications meet minimal scientific standards (how minimal will depend on the journal), and it imparts a level of credibility to anything that passes review. As far as I can determine, this paper doesn't meet even minimal scientific standards. By giving it the credibility of having been peer-reviewed anyway, the reviewers arguably failed in their duty.

I see two consequences of this failure: first of all a possible loss of credibility for open access journals (and this is not a good thing), and a possible loss of credibility for some sites (like physorg.com) that republish official press release without criticism.  
In this sense it could be a good occasion for a scientific network like _Field of Science_ to gain a lot of regular readers in the next months (and in particular I hope to write with more regularity in the future...)
