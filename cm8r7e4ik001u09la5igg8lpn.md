[_A mathematical theory of communication_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication) is a paper by [**Claude Shannon**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon) published in two part in July and October 1948. The paper posed the basis for the modern information theory and the basi elements of communication:

> *   An information source that produces a message
> *   A transmitter that operates on the message to create a signal which can be sent through a channel
> *   A channel, which is the medium over which the signal, carrying the information that composes the message, is sent
> *   A receiver, which transforms the signal back into the message intended for delivery
> *   A destination, which can be a person or a machine, for whom or which the message is intended
