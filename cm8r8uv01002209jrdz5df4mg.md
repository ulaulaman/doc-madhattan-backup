Wow, after seeing the image above, at reduced size, TPP was just sure the diagram was about hydrophyte stem anatomy. See for yourself [here](http://fineartamerica.com/featured/hydrophyte-stem-and-aerenchyma-m-i-walker.html).

Wonderful!!! It seems that the mathematics of amplituhedron could be fundamental not only for physics!

How do we distinguish between this being deep and fundamental, or merely a computational shortcut?

If using this computational shortcut we are able to find a model that is more fundamental than standard model, for example
