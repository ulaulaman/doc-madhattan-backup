> The top is supposed to be simmetrical about its axis, and spinning with its point in a small, smooth cup $O$, like the Maxwell top; as his apparatus is no longer procurable, a bicycle wheel will be found effective for experimental demonstration.  
> The physical constants of the top are given in C. G. S. units by  
>   
> (i) the weight W in grammes (g), as weighed in a balance;  
> (ii) the distance $h$ in centimetres (cm) between the point $O$ and the centre of gravity, and then $Wh$ (g-cm) may be called the _preponderance_;  
> (iii) $C\_1$ and $A\_1$, the moment of inertia (g-cm2) about the axis of figure $OC'$ and about any axis through $O$ at right angles to $OC'$.  
>   
> The moment of inertia $A\_1$ can be measured experimentally by swinging the top, without revolution about $OC'$, as a plane or conical pendulum, and observing the length $l$ (cm) of the equivalent simple pendulum, or the angular velocity $n$ (radians/second), or period $2\\pi/n$ (seconds), when swung without rotation as a conical pendulum of small angular aperture ; then  
> (1) \\\[l = \\frac{A\_1}{Wh}, \\qquad A\_1 = Whl\\\] (2) \\\[n^2 = \\frac{g}{l}= \\frac{Wgh}{A\_1}\\\]
