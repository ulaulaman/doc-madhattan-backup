I had been thinking about moving *Doc Madhattan* to another platform for a long time. Then, after the publication of the [post dedicated to my latest scientific papers](https://docmadhattan.hashnode.dev/geometric-model-of-particles-a-didactical-approach), I realized, by sharing it, that the security certificate was obsolete, so much so as to make the post unreachable for new readers. So I started thinking about moving the blog to a new blogging platform.

After a long search I stumbled upon [**Hashnode**](https://hashnode.com/), which also allows you to receive posts directly in your email inbox by [subscribing to the newsletter](https://docmadhattan.hashnode.dev/newsletter), a very useful tool.

I then moved the archive of posts to the [new blog](https://docmadhattan.hashnode.dev/) by first exporting and then converting them to markdown using [this converter](https://github.com/palaniraja/blog2md). The transition was not error-free and I had to manually insert a couple of posts, while [this one](http://docmadhattan.fieldofscience.com/2012/03/tara-shears-about-her-work-at-cern.html) is completely absent because the video inside, after more than ten years, is no longer available.

At the end of the transfer, I discovered that some comments and discussions under the posts were promoted to real posts on **Hashnode**. I deleted the ones I found, as well as the drafts that had become public when the backup was uploaded.

The mathematical equations, on the other hand, seem to have been interpreted correctly, apart from a few things that I hope to fix as I discover them, but with an archive of over 400 posts, your help could be useful, so **feel free to point out things that are wrong in the comments of this new introductory post**.

I will not stop using the blog on *Fields of Science*, however: in this case I will publish an excerpt of the post with a link to the full article on **Hashnode**: I do not want to forget the readers who continue to follow that platform, even if I invite them and all new readers to update their rss readers, blogrolls and [subscribe to the newsletter](https://docmadhattan.hashnode.dev/newsletter)!

*Doc Madhattan* is back and I hope to be able to publish a little more regularly than in previous years here on **Hashnode**!
