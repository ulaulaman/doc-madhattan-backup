The Basel problem, solved by Euler, shows the connection between pi (π) and the infinite series of reciprocals of square numbers:  
∑  
𝑛  
\=  
1  
∞  
1  
𝑛  
2  
\=  
𝜋  
2  
6  
∑  
n=1  
∞  
​  
  
n  
2  
  
1  
​  
\=  
6  
π  
2  
  
​  
. An easy way to understand this is to think of π as not just for circles but also in summing infinite sequences. Use resources like https://wordsolver.org/ to break down complex math terms into simpler, relatable words.
