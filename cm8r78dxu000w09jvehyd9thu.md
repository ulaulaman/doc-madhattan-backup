**Card Colm Mulcahy**, an irish mathematician and **John Conway**'s friend, on 11 april 2020 [published on twitter](https://twitter.com/CardColm/status/1249038195880341505) the news of the death of Conway. His source was [_a close associate of his_](https://twitter.com/CardColm/status/1249088354857226242) and [confirmed by the family](https://immiguy.com/death/john-conway-death-mathematician-john-conway-obituary-cause-of-death/?fbclid=IwAR2rnqFO7yWMbPZ6mL-prlfVrTzHh-OVwESQcT3wajRDvaNjM-bIWvISgT4).  
I written a little post in his honour on [_Maths in Europe_](http://mathematics-in-europe.eu/?p=1713), a ahort article about the free will theorem.  
The theorem was proposed by Conway with **Simon Kochen**, inspired by the question about the interpretation of quantum mechanics. The statement is:

> If the choice of directions in which to perform spin 1 experiments is not afunction of the information accessible to the experimenters, then the responsesof the particles are equally not functions of the information accessible to them.
