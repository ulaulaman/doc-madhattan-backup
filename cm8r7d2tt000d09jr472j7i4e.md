There is a new animated series in the city([1](#fn:stefano "See footnote")): _Super Science Friends_. Created by **Brett Jubinville** of [_Tinman Creative Studios_](http://www.tinman.tv/), it was funded the first short through _Kickstarter_, while the rest of the episodes can be [supported on _Patreon_](https://www.patreon.com/supersciencefriends).  
The series is evidently inspired by _Super Friends_, produced by **Hanna-Barbera** for _DC Comics_, with the place of the heroes of _JLA_ taken by some iconic scientists: **Marie Curie**, with a radioactive ring similar to _Green Lantern_’s one; **Charles Darwin**, able to transform into any animal, like _Beast Boy_ from the _Teen Titans_; **Nikola Tesla**, with electromagnetic powers, like _Magneto_ from _Marvel_ universe, historical _X-Men_ enemy; **Sigmund Freud**, father of psychoanalysis with oversight of lust, to be seen as an alternative to _Aquaman_ with his oversight of aquatic creatures.  
Added to these is the little-known **Tapputi**, which she is the first legendary alchemist in history, can generate visions, mostly erotic on his person, thanks to her concoctions, like the _Scarecrow_, _Batman_ opponent Batman.  
The last member of the team, officially on the bench, is the **Albert Einstein**'s fourteen clone, with the super speed and temperamentally modeled on _Impulse_, young sidekick of the third _Flash_.  
The _Super Science Friends_ were assembled, thanks to time travel, by **Winston Chucrhill** with the intent to counter the advance of Nazism.

In the first episode, _The Phantom Premise_, the superteam will investigate the disappearance of apples from Britain in 1665, which, of course, will put them to see **Isaac Newton** who, according to the legend, was inspired by an apple that has fallen on the head for the formulation of his law of universal gravitation.
