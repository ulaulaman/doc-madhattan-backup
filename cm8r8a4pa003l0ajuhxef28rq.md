The following video is a song about Maxwell's equations. Lyrics are written by **David Olson** with the basis of *Let it be* by ***Beatles***.  
Enjoy!

> Interestingly, Maxwell's equations have been drastically reduced into a language of differential geometry. These four sets of equations which perfectly describe the theory of electromagnetism have been reduced to a set of two equations which lay the foundations of most new theories in the physical world today.  
> The most revolutionary quantum leap in the history of theoretical physics is the birth of general relativity and quantum field theory (the standard model of elementary particle). These theories describe nature better than any physicist ever had at hand, although they have not been uni ed into a coherent picture of the world. One of the main ingredients of these theories is differential geometry. Euclidean geometry was abandoned in favour of differential geometry and classical field theories had to be quantized.  
> Maxwell's equations in the language of differential geometry lead to a generalization to these new theories, and these equations are a special case of Yang-Mills equations (beyond the scope of this essay), which is also gauge invariant and describe not only electromagnetism but also the strong and weak nuclear forces. This essay is nothing but the tip of the iceberg.
