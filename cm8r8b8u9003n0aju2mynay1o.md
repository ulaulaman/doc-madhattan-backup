Today ATLAS and CMS will present, during two scientific conferences, their results with the complete set of data from 2011. ATLAS has also released a preprint, submitted to the Physical Review D, in which the experiment propose a measure for the Higgs mass: $m\_H = 126GeV$ with a significance of $2.9 \\sigma$ ([like I wrote yesterday](http://docmadhattan.fieldofscience.com/2012/07/higgs-probably-not-tomorrow.html)). There are not the numbers for a discover, but we are really close to the Higgs boson, like **John Ellis** explains in the following video:
