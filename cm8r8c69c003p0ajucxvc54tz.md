This comics watercolor is drawned by **Davide Osenda**, a computer engineer and cartoonists. His first comics is about mathematics, the italian graphic novel _L'ultima lezione a Gottinga_ (_The last lesson in Gottinga_), about **Cantor** and the mathematics of transfinite numbers. Now it seems that he's working to a comics inspired by _This is water_, a speech by **David Foster Wallace**. So I propose you the audio of that speech:
