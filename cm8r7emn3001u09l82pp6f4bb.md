[**Herman Hollerith**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Hollerith), an American inventor, was born on the 29th February 1860. His most famous invention was the electromechanical tabulation of data:

> At the urging of [**John Shaw Billings**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Shaw_Billings), Hollerith developed a mechanism using electrical connections to trigger a counter, recording information. A key idea was that data could be encoded by the locations of holes in a card. Hollerith determined that data punched in specified locations on a card, in the now-familiar rows and columns, could be counted or sorted mechanically. A description of this system, _An Electric Tabulating System_ (1889), was submitted by Hollerith to Columbia University as his doctoral thesis, and is reprinted in Randell's book.

In the [patent of his invention](http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=US&NR=395782&KC=&FT=E&locale=en_EP), we can read:

> The herein-described method of compiling statistics, which consists in recording separate statistical items pertaining to the individual by holes or combinations of holes punched in sheets of electrically non-conducting material, and bearing a specific relation to each other and to a standard, and then counting or tallying such statistical items separately or in combination by means of mechanical counters operated by electro-magnets the circuits through which are controlled by the perforated sheets, substantially as and for the purpose set forth.

In 1896 Hollerith founded _The Tabulating Machine Company_, that in 1911, with four others company, became the _Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company_, renamed _International Business Machines_ (IBM) in 1924.
