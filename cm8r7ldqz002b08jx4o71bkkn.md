> A [**heavy metal**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_(chemistry)) is any metal or metalloid of environmental concern. The term originated with reference to the harmful effects of cadmium, mercury and lead, all of which are denser than iron. It has since been applied to any other similarly toxic metal, or metalloid such as arsenic, regardless of density. Commonly encountered heavy metals are chromium, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, arsenic, selenium, silver, cadmium, antimony, mercury, thallium and lead.

Heavy metals have a lot of detrimental effects on our body:

* * *

**Aluminum** - Damage to the central nervous system, dementia, memory loss  
**Antimony** - Damage to heart, diarrhea, vomiting, stomach ulcer  
**Arsenic** - Lymphatic cancer, liver cancer, skin cancer  
**Barium** - Increased blood pressure, paralysis  
**Bismuth** - Dermatitis, stomatitis, colitis, diarrhea  
**Cadmium** - Diarrhea, stomach pains, vomiting, bone fractures, damage to the immune, psychological disorders  
**Chrome** - Damage to the kidneys and liver, respiratory problems, lung cancer, death  
**Copper** - Irritation of the nose, mouth and eyes, liver cirrhosis, brain damage and kidney  
**Gallium** - Irritation of the throat, difficulty 'breathing, pain in the chest  
**Hafnium** - Irritation of eyes, skin and mucous membranes  
**Indium** - Damage to the heart, kidneys and liver  
**Iridium** - Irritation of the eyes and digestive tract  
**Lanthanum** - Lung cancer, liver damage  
**Lead** - Fruits, vegetables, meats, cereals, wine, cigarettes contain. Cause brain damage, dysfunction at birth, kidney damage, learning disabilities, destruction of the nervous system  
**Manganese** - Blood clotting, glucose intolerance, disorders of the skeleton  
**Mercury** - Destruction of the nervous system, brain damage, DNA damage  
**Nickel** - Pulmonary embolism, breathing difficulties, asthma and chronic bronchitis, allergic skin reaction  
**Palladium** - Very toxic and carcinogenic, irritant  
**Platinum** - Alterations of DNA, cancer, and damage to intestine and kidney  
**Rhodium** - Stains the skin, potentially toxic and carcinogenic  
**Ruthenium** - Very toxic and carcinogenic, damage to the bones  
**Scandium** - Pulmonary embolism, threatens the liver when accumulated in the body  
**Silver** - Used as a coloring agent E174, headache, breathing difficulties, skin allergies, with extreme concentration it causes coma and death  
**Strontium** - Lung cancer, in children difficulty of bone development  
**Tantalum** - Irritation to the eyes and to the skin, upper respiratory tract lesion  
**Thallium** - Used as a rat poison, stomach damage, nervous system, coma and death for those who survive the remain Thallium nerve damage and paralysis  
**Tin** - Irritation of the eyes and skin, headaches, stomach aches, difficulty to urinate  
**Tungsten** - Damage to the mucous membranes and membranes, eye irritation  
**Vanadium** - heart and cardiovascular disorders, inflammation of the stomach and intestine  
**Yttrium** - Very toxic, lung cancer, pulmonary embolism, liver damage
