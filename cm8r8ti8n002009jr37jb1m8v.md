Wikipedia [writes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towel_Day "Towel Day Wikipedia"):  

> **Towel Day** is celebrated every 25 May as a tribute by fans of the late author **Douglas Adams**. On this day, fans carry a towel with them to demonstrate their love for the books and the author, as referenced in Adams's _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_. The commemoration was first held in 2001, two weeks after Adams's death on 11 May 2001.

I forget my towel, so I post this Linus image: **don't panic**!

I search on Scholar _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_ and I find some references  
[_The Hitchhiker's Guide To Teaching Legal Research To The Google Generation_](http://law.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3849&context=expresso) (pdf)  
[A guide to the _Guide_](http://goo.gl/f152x) by **Cohen-Rose** and **Christiansen** (Google Books preview)  
[_Equation-of-Motion Coupled-Cluster Methods for Open-Shell and Electronically Excited Species: **The Hitchhiker's Guide** to Fock Spacez_](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.physchem.59.032607.093602) by **Anna I. Krylov**  
And there's also a ref. in **Penrose**'s book [_The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_to_Reality:_A_Complete_Guide_to_the_Laws_of_the_Universe)  
I conclude with a video from the official site of [Towel Day](http://www.towelday.org/)
