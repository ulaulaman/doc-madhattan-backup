Do you remember the [conference of ATLAS and CMS about their Higgs' preliminary results](http://docmadhattan.fieldofscience.com/2011/12/higgs-day.html)? Well. Today during [Moriond 2012 conference](http://indico.in2p3.fr/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=6001), the two Tevatron's collaboration, CDF and D0, presented their results about Higgs research:

(the plot shows the upper limit on the Higgs boson production rate)

In synthesis they confirm LHC's results (Tevatron's Higgs range: 115 GeV - 135 GeV, with $sigma = 2.2$).
