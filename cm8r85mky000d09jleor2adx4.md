> The bright star _Epsilon Aurigae_ (HD 31964) is a single-lined spectroscopic binary that is famous for its long orbital period (27.1 yr), which is punctuated by an almost two-year long eclipse caused by an essentially invisible object.  
> By examining the optical spectra of _Epsilon Aurigae_ near the end of its 1954-1956 eclipse, Hack(1) was able to deduce the electron density and develop the hypothesis of a Be-star-like hot object at the center of a large disk of occulting material(2).

(1) Margherita Hack compared her observations with Adams and Sanford (1929, published the next year):

> The spectrum shows a doubling of the lines similar to that in 1929, with the violet component appearing to originate in a very rarefied shell, which surrounds an invisible star in accordance with Struve's hypothesis (1956) and is responsible of the observed eclipse. The study of the shell spectrum by means of the curve of growth shows dilution of radiation effecfts.

(2) Some of the reported observations were subsequently revised by other researchers, but the road was basically that

> several evidences consistently suggest that the invisible companion is a hot star responsible for the excitation of a gaseous shell surrounding it. This shell is the body responsible for the eclipse of the principal star. The invisible companion probably is a P Cygni star of absolute visual magnitude -4 or -5, and effective temperature of 20000 or 30000 K.

About the shell, with Ferluga, she observed that

> this shell is responsible for selectively absorbing the primary's light and producing the "shell" spectrum.  
> (...)  
> We may wonder how it is possible for the gaseous, partially ionized shell to coexist with the cool object. We think that the light of the hot secondary escaping from the poles is able to excite and ionize the thin gaseous shell which extends farther out of the orbital plane, while a cool disk or ring surrounding the secondary and eclipsing the primary lies in vicinity of the orbital plane, and makes the secondary appear fainter than it really is.
