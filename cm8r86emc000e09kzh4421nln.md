In the mid-March at [Moriond 2013](http://moriond.in2p3.fr/) [ATLAS](http://atlas.ch/blog/) and [CMS](http://cms.web.cern.ch/news/new-cms-results-moriond-qcd-2013) presented the last results about the research of the Higgs' boson. While [CMS reduced the excess](http://sites.uci.edu/energyobserver/2013/03/15/update-on-higgs-from-cms-presented-at-moriond-qcd-on-march-14-2013/) for the $H \\rightarrow \\gamma \\gamma$ decay channell, [ATLAS continued to observe it](http://sites.uci.edu/energyobserver/2013/03/07/update-on-higgs-data-presented-at-moriond-march-6-2013/). This result could be a clue that the boson discovered and announced last year is only the first of a series of Higgs' bosons. Indeed, [following **Albert De Roeck**](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23274-higgs-keeps-mum-about-universes-secrets--for-now.html) of CSM, the photon decay could be connected with...

In order to resolve the question (is the new boson **the only** Higgs' boson or **simply a** Higgs' boson?) we have to wait the end of the maintenance work of LHC, but in the meantime we could play with the _Quark Matter Card Game_, in particular the variant named [_Higgs Boson - on Your Own_](http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.2732)!

> **Object of the game**: to win, by detecting a decay of a Higgs boson. If this does not happen in a given game, one can win by statistics, by collecting the largest number of particle cards.

The proposed game is a variation of _Memory_

> **The course of the game**: The players put the thoroughly shuffled pack to the middle then make an ordered, e.g. 6x11 table of the cards, that all are placed in a face down position, initially. Players follow each other in a sequential, e.g. counter-clockwise order. This Higgs-boson â€“ on Your Own is a Memory style game, it starts similarly to the Memory of Quark Matter Card Game.

You could realize a series of valid configuration, like meson, baryon, anti-baryon, or the Higgs decay (below two examples):

$H \\rightarrow Z^0 Z^0 \\rightarrow l^+ \\nu l^- \\bar{\\nu}$

And so... Play the game!
