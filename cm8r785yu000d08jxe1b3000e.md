**Alessio Zanuta**

Astrophisicts of Brera's Astronmical Observatory in Milano are collaborating with researchers at Milano University are developing and testing [ultraviolet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet) devices for air disinfection and inactivation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The italian science magazine, Media INAF, [has interviewed **Alessio Zanuta**](https://www.media.inaf.it/2020/04/24/uv-covid/). [Here there is the english tranlsation](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=it&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.media.inaf.it%2F2020%2F04%2F24%2Fuv-covid%2F). In the post I extracted an interesting quote:

> (...) we are developing new ideas for fighting the virus in terms of disinfection  
> First of all by conducting targeted studies to understand how it behaves and which are in weak points of this virus if subjected to radiation. We speak above all of ultraviolet rays, and we wonder if they are effective in inactivating it, at what wavelengths, how long exposure it takes, and what doses. While there is a large literature on how Uv rays - especially the most energetic ones (the so-called Uv-C rays) - have effective sanitizing effects also on viruses, currently specific information on the doses necessary to specifically annihilate the Sars-Cov-2 virus is lacking responsible for the current pandemic. This bibliography information is missing right now, either because the virus is new, or because the similarities with other types of viruses are labile. After collecting all the necessary data, we aim to develop devices useful for disinfection. Furthermore, the idea that even less energetic rays, those emitted by the Sun and which are not absorbed by the atmosphere, can have a disinfectant effect, with important epidemiological consequences and with interesting information to manage the so-called "Phase 2" in return from the lockdown. In the summer, there could be a drop in infections, also thanks to greater illumination by the Sun.
