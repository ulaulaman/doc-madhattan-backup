[_Bridges: Mathematical Connections in Art, Music, and Science_](http://bridgesmathart.org/) (discovered via [Mr Honner](http://mrhonner.com/2011/08/12/math-art-space-filling-cube/)) is an annual conference where mathematicians, scientists and artists explore the mathematical connections between these subjects. In particular today is the poetry day, and I decide to publish an interesting scientific poetry, that was submitted and published on _Nature_!  
**Frederick Soddy**, who winned the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1921, composed _The Kiss Precise_, in which he rediscovered the _Descartes' Circle Theorem_

> originally proved by Rene Descartes, which involves the radii of four mutually tangent circles

He wrote his result in verses:

> For pairs of lips to kiss maybe  
> Involves no trigonometry.  
> 'Tis not so when four circles kiss  
> Each one the other three.  
> To bring this off the four must be  
> As three in one or one in three.  
> If one in three, beyond a doubt  
> Each gets three kisses from without.  
> If three in one, then is that one  
> Thrice kissed internally.  
> Four circles to the kissing come.  
> The smaller are the benter.  
> The bend is just the inverse of  
> The distance from the center.  
> Though their intrigue left Euclid dumb  
> There's now no need for rule of thumb.  
> Since zero bend's a dead straight line  
> And concave bends have minus sign,  
> The sum of the squares of all four bends  
> Is half the square of their sum.(1, 2)

The most interesting thing is the generalization of the result, that was submitted also(7) in poem by **Thorold Gosset**:

> And let us not confine our cares  
> To simple circles, planes and spheres,  
> But rise to hyper flats and bends  
> Where kissing multiple appears,  
> In n-ic space the kissing pairs  
> Are hyperspheres, and Truth declares,  
> As n + 2 such osculate  
> Each with an n + 1 fold mate  
> The square of the sum of all the bends  
> Is n times the sum of their squares.(3, 4)

It's interesting to observe that Soddy's poetry is the oldest poem submitted to a scientific journal, being older than [_The Detection of Shocked Co/ Emission from G333.6-0.2_](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1984PASAu...5..566S) by **J. W. V. Storey**, published in 1984 on the _Proceedings of the Astronomical Society of Australia_ and [discovered by **Maria Popova**](http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2012/07/12/first-science-poem-2/).

A generalization of Descrates' Circle Theorem(9)

But, following **Sarah Glaz**(2), the oldest use of mathematics in poetry was made by **Archimedes** with _The Cattle Problem_ that you can read in english translation in _Solving the Pell Equation_ by **H. W. Lenstra Jr.** ([pdf](http://www.ams.org/notices/200202/fea-lenstra.pdf)). About this specific problem, you can find a simple [statement](http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Cattle/Statement.html), and the solution ([part 1](http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Cattle/Solution1.html) and [part 2](http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Cattle/Solution2.html)) by [**Chris Rorres**](http://www.cs.drexel.edu/~crorres/).

> A manuscript containing this problem was discovered by Lessing in the Wolffenbüttel library, and published by him in 1773. It is now generally credited to Archimedes. In twenty-two Greek elegiac distichs, the problem asks for the number of white, black, dappled, and brown bulls and cows belonging to the Sun god, subject to several arithmetical restrictions.(5)

We can reduce the problem like a system of 7 equations with 8 unknowns, so the system is indeterminare and we can find an infinity of solutions. The best we can do is find a parametric solution, in other words we can write the number of the oxen depending by an integer or real parameter.  
An aid in determining solutions is surely came from the computation. In particular I report to you the paper by **Hugh C. Williams**, **R. A. German** and **Charles Robert Zarnke**(10): they used a couple of IBM, the 7040 and the 1620 to be precise!  
Another interesting and particularly curios example of mathematics in poetry is [_A square in verse of a hundred monasillbles only: Describing the sense of England's happiness_](http://joannegrowney.com/InfoLokSquare.htm) by **Henry Lok**. In this case we have a series of words written in a square pattern like sudoku. Various interpretations of the text are possible, for example the following by **Roche**:

> God makes kings rule for heaue\[n\]s; your state hold blest  
> And still stand will their shields; fear yields best rest.(6)

It seems also that some others poems are embedded in Lok composition(6).  
I would conclude the post with this poetry, \[883\], by **Emily Dickinson** (via [JoAnne Growney](http://poetrywithmathematics.blogspot.it/2012/06/emily-dickinson-and-circumference.html))

> The Poets light but Lamps—  
> Themselves—go out—  
> The Wicks they stimulate—  
> If vital Light  
>   
> Inhere as do the Suns—  
> Each Age a Lens  
> Disseminating their  
> Circumference—
