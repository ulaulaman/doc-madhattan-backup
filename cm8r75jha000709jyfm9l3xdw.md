_The hand of creation_ by **John Byrne** from _Green Lantern: Ganthet's Tale_

The [XENON1T experiment](http://www.xenon1t.org/) at [Gran Sasso's laboratories](http://w3.lnf.infn.it/) in Italy is a liquid xenon detector designed for serach of the mysterious dark matter. About one year ago researchers [observed an excess of events](https://www.lngs.infn.it/en/news/xenon1t-excess-events): 53 more than the 232 predicted([1](#fn1)).  
There are several explanations: an unexpected noise' source; the passage of some axions, an hypothetical particle predicted by [**Roberto Peccei** and **Helen Quinn** in 1977](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peccei%E2%80%93Quinn_theory); some neutrinos that interact with matter in a new way.  
Or dark matter's traces([2](#fn2)). There are two new articles suggesting this; in particular the second suggests that the detected excess in XENON1T is dued by chameleons([3](#fn3)).  
The [chameleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chameleon_particle) is an(other) hypothetical particle proposed in 2003 by **Justin Khoury** and **Amanda Weltman**, that couples to matter more weakly than gravity, and so a candidate for dark matter. It has a variable mass, so the hypothetical fifth force mediated by the chameleons can evade the constraints deduced by experiments on the equivalence principle. In this way chameleons could drive the observed acceleration of the universe's expansion, but it's very difficult to verify experimentally.
