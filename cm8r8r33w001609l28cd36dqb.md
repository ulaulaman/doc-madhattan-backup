> A group velocity faster than $c$ does not mean that photons or neutrinos are moving faster thsn the speed of light.

This is the conclusion of _Fast light, fast neutrinos?_ by **Kevin Cahill**(12). He start his briefly analisys from some experimental observations of superluminal group velocity. In these experiments researchers measure a speed of light faster and slower than $c$ in vacuum. The first observation was occured in 1982(1), but an interesting collection of work in this subject is in **Bigelow**(7) and **Gehring**(11). Experimentally when some pulses journey into a highly dispersive media occur some exotic effects. One of these is the observation of a negative group velocity, that coincides with a superluminal speed.  
In Bigelow's and Gehring's works wasn't a really theoretical explenation. For example Bigelow proposed the following explaination:

> (...) as the combination of different absorption cross sections and lifetimes for Cr3+ ions at either mirror or inversion sites within the BeAl2O4 crystal lattice. The superluminal wave propagation is produced by a narrow “antihole” \[612 Hz half width at half maximum (HWHM)\] in the absorption spectrum of Cr3+ ions at the mirror sites of the alexandrite crystal lattice, and the slow light originates from an even narrower hole (8.4 Hz) in the absorption spectrum of Cr3+ ions at the inversion sites.

They also considered

> (...) the influence of ions both at the inversion sites and at the mirror sites. In addition, the absorption cross sections are assumed to be different at different wavelengths.

_The arrows indicate the locations of ion sites that have mirror or inversion symmetry. On the right, the corresponding energy-level diagrams for Cr3+ ions at the different sites are shown._

Gehring and collegues, instead, write that:

> (...) theory predicts that the peak of the transmitted pulse will exit the material before the peak of the incident pulse enters thematerial, and furthermore that the pulsewill appear to propagate in the backward directionwithin the medium(2, 3, 4).

_In (a) experimentally measured group delay vs. crystal rotation;  
in (b) the weak value $\\left \[A\_\\beta \\right \]\_W$ vs frequency_(9)

Another theoretical explenation was proposed in Brunner(10) where researchers proposed the quantum formalism of weak values developed by [**Aharonov** and **Vaidman**](http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0105101). The connection between weak values and superluminal velocity was examined and proofed by [**Daniel Solli**](http://solli.bol.ucla.edu/ "Daniel Solli")(8, 9), who proposed the following experiment:

> Our experimental system consists of a slab of highly birefringent two-dimensional (2D) photonic crystal and a linear polarizer, placed in series. The photonic crystal has fundamental and second-order photonic band gaps in the regions of 10 and 20 GHz, and displays strong birefringence with very high transmission in the frequency range between the two gaps(6). The crystal itself is an 18-layer hexagonal array of hollow acrylic rods (outer diameter 1/2”) with an air-ﬁlling fraction (AFF) of 0.60. The crystal was constructed using a method which we have previously described(5)

In particular the group velocity is defined by \\\[v\_g = \\frac{L}{t\_f + < t > }\\\] where $L$ is the lenght of the medium crossed by the pulse, $t\_f$ the free propagation time and $< t >$ _the mean time of arrival once the free propagation has been subtracted_(10), that it can be expressed like a function of the weak value $W$: \\\[< t > = \\frac{\\delta \\tau}{2}{\\text Re} W\\\] with $\\delta t$ _the temporal shift between the two eigenmodes_(10).  
Using the weak formalism Antonio Mecozzi and Marco Bellini(13) try to explain the [recently OPERA's superluminal neutrinos](http://docmadhattan.fieldofscience.com/2011/09/waiting-superluminal-neutrinos-if-they.html) imagining a similar effect also for these particles. Their theoretical calculation was reproduced by Berry, Brunner (the same of the experimental paper in note 10), Popescu and Shukla(14), but they also confront theoretical result with experimental observations. And finally they find that the effect of the weak formalism is too... weak in order to explain OPERA's observation.

**In conclusion**, after a brief story about superluminal signals in optics, sir Michael Berry (I hope to write something in future about his famous geometrical phase). with Brunner _et al._, quest: _Can superluinal neutrino speeds be explained as a quantum weak measurement?_  
An the answer is in the abstract:

> Probably not.

And it is defined the _best abstract ever_ by [Improbable research](http://www.improbable.com/2011/10/14/ig-nobel-winner-writes-best-abstract-ever/). Indeed, I remember that Berry winned IgNoble in 2000 with Andre Geim.

**About neutrinos**: there's a lot of news (i hope to write something about the preprints proposed). For example [paper by **Ronald van Elburg**](http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/27260/), in which author supposed that OPERA collaboration forgotten to examine some lorentzian effects.  
And you also just read the [preprint by **Glashow** and **Cohen**](http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.6562) in which the two theorists refute the superluminal interpretation of OPERA results. Well, [some days ago ICARUS](http://www.science20.com/quantum_diaries_survivor/icarus_refutes_operas_superluminal_neutrinos-83684), an experiment designed and directed by **Carlo Rubbia** based on Gran Sasso National Laboratory (the same laboratory of OPERA) [confirmed in a preprint](http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.3763) Glashow's and Cohen's ideas.  
**Finally**, Torino's INFN published a page with [all superluminal preprints](http://www.nu.to.infn.it/SuperLuminal_Neutrino/). And you can see also [my little storify](http://storify.com/ulaulaman/superluminars-preprint) with some preprints about the question.
