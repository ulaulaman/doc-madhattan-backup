A couple of mathematical abstracts from arXiv:

> This article discusses an experience of teaching Calculus classes for the freshmen students enrolled at Sungkyunkwan University, one of the private universities in South Korea. The teaching and learning approach is a balance combination between the teacher-oriented traditional style of lecturing and other activities that encourage students for active learning and classroom participation. Based on the initial observation during several semesters, some anecdotal evidences show that students' learning is improved after implementing this student-oriented active learning approach, albeit a longer period of time is definitely needed to transform general students' attitude from passive learners to active ones.

From the conclusion I would emphasize the following paragraph:

> From this study we have seen some anecdotal evidences that students' learning is improved when they are actively engaged with the study material, instead of only sitting passively in the classroom and listening to the lecture. More success can be achieved when the classroom activities are also fun. With a proper balance between lecturing and engaging students new concepts and activities in which students, alone or in groups, need to struggle themselves with these concepts, makes the learning time in the classroom more effective and the time spent in class becomes more enjoyable for the students. Students also show appreciation for this style of teaching. Despite classroom participation and group activities are generally more successful in classes with a small number of students, some promising and good results have been accomplished even though the class sizes were relatively large.

> The first 2x2x2 twisty cube was created as a demonstration tool by Erno Rubik in 1974 to help his students understand the complexity of space and the movements in 3D. He fabricated a novel 3x3x3 mechanism where the 26 cubies were turning, and twisting independently, without falling apart. The cube was dressed in sophisticated colors which made it a unique puzzle. Even without instruction is the aim of the game was self-explanatory. Its educational value in VSI (Visual-Spatial Intelligence), developing strategy, memorization and logistics, improve concentration and persistence in problem solving is high in every age group. A logical puzzle has outreach far beyond. Those aspects are briefly covered in this article.
