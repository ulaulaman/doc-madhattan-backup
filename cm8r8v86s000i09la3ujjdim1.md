Thank you for posting these wonderful illustrations, Gianluigi. These (and the rest in this book) were Sendak's first published work. And there's a back-story to them: Sendak was "not a good student"; he didn't like school and did poorly in his classes. One day, his teacher, Mr. Ruchlis, said to him, "Sendak, you will pass my course AND I'll give you $100 IF you do the illustrations for my book." Sendak later said he would have done it just to pass the course! But the $100 represented his first "commission," the first time he was paid for his talent -- even before he did illustrations for comic books and childrens books. So these you've posted here are rare early examples of a great artist's great talent.
