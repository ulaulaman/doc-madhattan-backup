In our standard model of elementary particles we have four fundamental interactions: gravity, electromagnetism, strong nuclear force and weak interaction. In particular the last force is responsible for the radioactive decay and for the hydrogen fusion in stars. The bosons of the interaction (the particle exchanged between two fermions) are $W^\\pm$ and $Z$ bosons. An example of weak interaction is $\\pi^+$ decay:

The weak bosons are predicted in 1968 by Glashow, Weinberg and Salam(1) and discovered at CERN in 1983 in a series of experiments conducted by **Carlo Rubbia** and **Simon van der Meer**(2). Now, from one of the last analysis from Tevatron, we have the last measure of W bosons. Indeed CDF's researchers propose the following preliminary value for $W$: \\\[M\_W = (80.387 \\pm 0.019) GeV\\\] and combining it with previous measures, the new preliminary world average is

**I must remember** that $(80.390 \\pm 0.016) GeV$ will became the new $W$ mass only after the publication of the [CDF's preprint](http://www-cdf.fnal.gov/physics/ewk/2012/wmass/) ([pdf](http://www-cdf.fnal.gov/physics/ewk/2012/wmass/wmass_conf.pdf)) in a peer review journal and after the publication of the further calculation on the [Particle Data Group](http://pdg.lbl.gov/). Indeed [Wired](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/02/w-boson-higgs/) (and [en.wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=W_and_Z_bosons&oldid=478613389), [following Wired](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=W_and_Z_bosons&oldid=478613389)), following [Tommaso Dorigo](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/02/w-boson-higgs/), who simply described the experimental process that carries to the measure and to the new proposal, has just setted the new mass, forgetting the reviewing scientific process. So, until then, the average mass is $(80.399 \\pm 0.023) GeV$(3).

> for their contributions to the theory of the unified weak and electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles, including, inter alia, the prediction of the weak neutral current

I would emphasazie three key concepts in the theory: _symmetry_, _gauge theory_ and _renormalization_.  
**Symmetry**, I hope, is clear: a transformation that not change, for example, a physical system. But in physics we use a lot of **gauge theories**: in this case our systems are invariant (not change) under **local** (and not global) symmetry transformations (and the set of these transformations form a continuous group). So it's very important to clarify the difference between global and local: for **global transformation**, we mean a transformation that acts on the whole space; for **local transformation**, we mean a transformation that acts, unchanging the system, in the neighbourhoods of the point that I study (in few words, a local transformation acts in a little parte of the space).  
And finally the **renormalization** is a trick used to forgot the divergence in theory (I hope to write for a future post a more detailed explenation of renormalization)!  
In every case, you can read the theoretical background in the three Nobel lessons, in particular Glashow's one, that is _simple but not trivial_:

I would notice that in 1973, at CERN, there were the first observation of the neutral current, and this is one of the most intriguing problems solved in the model.

**Update**: I forgot to write somthing about the **Particle Data Group**. It is an international collaborations of particle physicists that compile the results about particles and fundamental forces after the pubblication of the experimental data on peer review journals. We consider the official publications of the PDG (_Review of Particle Physics_ and _Particle Data Booklet_) like the Bible of particles and the official source for constants and mass that we must use in papers. The data are updated annually on web and biennially on the _Review of Particle Physics_.
