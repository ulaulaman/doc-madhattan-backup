If you are a superheroes' comics readers, you probably know _All-Star Superman_ by **Grant Morrison** and **Frank Quitely** (if you want, I could publish a review of this comic). At some point in the story, Superman designs a small cubic universe to see what would happen on a planet like Earth without his presence. The development of intelligent life was also included in the Superman's simulation, but in essence even those of astronomers are structured in the same way: a cube of space of finite dimensions whose evolution is driven by a network of dark matter and dark energy.  
At the end of the july 2021 [it was realased _Uchuu_](https://www.cfca.nao.ac.jp/en/pr/20210910?fbclid=IwAR29QbP_ilNmpvCTC8ss3GWofHrreDCW0z_DUPUS5g2SJjjHBhoW2ZDlagI), presented as a _suite of large high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations_, in practice, a simulation that shows the evolution of dark matter structures in a cube of 9.63 billion light years on each side and made up of 2.1 trillion particles.

Uchuu's main goal is to shed light on the dark matter halos surrounding galaxies, but the researchers think that another field of use for their simulation is the study of gravitational lenses.  
In any case, it is a tool that could be very useful for improving the algorithms generally used in astronomy to process the data collected by instruments such as satellites and telescopes.
