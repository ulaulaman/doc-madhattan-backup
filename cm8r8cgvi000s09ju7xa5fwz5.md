The pressure in a fluid depends only by the deep $h$ and the density of the fluid $\\rho\_f$: \\\[p = \\rho\_f h g\\\] where $g$ is the gravity.  
We could consider also the generalized stevin law \\\[p = \\rho\_f h g + p\_0\\\] where $p\_0$ is the atmospheric pressure at sea level, but in order to explain the starting sequence in the following animation the first equation is sufficient.
