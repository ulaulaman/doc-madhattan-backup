[On twitter **Filippo Menconi**](https://twitter.com/#!/FilippoMarver) shared [an incredible flash applet](http://www.astrosurf.com/sguisard/Anim-astro/Paranal-Gegenshein/SGU-Paranal-Gegenshein-S-900x600.html) realized with [**StÃ©phane Guisard**](http://www.astrosurf.com/sguisard/)'s photos. The applet is intercative: for example you can change point of view simply moving the mouse up and down, rigth and left. After some experiment, I try to realize a little video using the applet. I produce two videos, without changing in point of view. In particular I propose you the video with _Clouds over us_(1) by **Seeking for a name** like soundtrack:

I hope that you can like this little experiment. In every case, if you are curious, in the following part of the post, you can read the procedure that I use:  
I realize the video capturing the area of the applet with XVidCap Screen Capture (software for Ubuntu) and I add the soundtrack using **mencoder**.  
To install it, I run the following line(2) in the console:

> _sudo apt-get install mencoder_

And now I run this line(2) in order to add _Clouds over us_ to the video generated by XVidCap:

> _mencoder test.mpeg -o video01.avi -ovc copy -oac mp3lame -audiofile music.mp3_

I also realize a video without sound ([see on YouTube](http://youtu.be/7zbozREdXZ4)). In this case first of all I install mplayer(3)

> _apt-get install scrot mplayer_

and after I start the screen capture procedure(3):

> _while \[ 1 \]; do scrot -q 100 $(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).jpg; sleep 1; done_

In this case I capture the entire screen, so before the realization of the video, I must extract from about 100 images the portion of the sky. In order to complete this operation without mistakes I install the [David's Batch Processor](http://members.ozemail.com.au/~hodsond/dbp.html)(4), a GIMP's plugin. After the resize, I list all files in a txt(3)

> _ls -1tr \*.jpg > files.txt_

and produce the video(3)

> _mencoder -ovc x264 -mf w=900:h=600:fps=8:type=bmp 'mf://@files.txt' -o video02.avi_

Remember: all lines must run in the fold of the images. In alternative you must write the complete path of files.
