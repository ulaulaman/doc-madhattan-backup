> With the help of ESOâ€™s Very Large Telescope (VLT), astronomers have found six galaxies lying around a supermassive black hole when the Universe was less than a billion years old. This is the first time such a close grouping has been seen so soon after the Big Bang and the finding helps us better understand how supermassive black holes, one of which exists at the centre of our Milky Way, formed and grew to their enormous sizes so quickly. It supports the theory that black holes can grow rapidly within large, web-like structures which contain plenty of gas to fuel them.

The location of the supermassive black hole is in the Sextans' constellation.  
Sextans is a small and dark constellation straddling the celestial equator and located near Leo. Introduced in 1687 by **Johannes Hevelius**, thanks to its equatorial position, the Sextant is visible from most of the Earth's surface.  
The main stars are not particularly bright, but with a particularly clean sky it is possible to identify them even with the naked eye, in particular _Alpha Sextantis_, a blue-white giant with a magnitude of 4.48, and _35 Sextantis_, an orange double star, the whose main star has a magnitude of 5.79. Also noteworthy there are the white _Gamma Sextantis_ (magnitude 5.07) and the blue _Beta Sextantis_ (magnitude 5.08).
