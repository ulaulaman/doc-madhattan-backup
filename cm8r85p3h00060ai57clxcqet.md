> My invention relates to improvements in grave alarms, whereby persons who are prematurely buried before life is extinct, can sound an alarm, thus notifying the cemetery officials of the fact.  
> The object of my invention, is not only to provide means for sounding an alarm, but also to provide an improved construction whereby fresh air is supplied to the person prematurely buried, whereby life may be sustained until help arrives.
