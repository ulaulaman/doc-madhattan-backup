A scientific poetry by **Richard Feynman** from _The value of science_ ([pdf](http://www.math.ucla.edu/~mwilliams/feynman.pdf)):

> There are the rushing waves  
> mountains of molecules  
> each stupidly minding its own business  
> trillions apart  
> yet forming white surf in unison.  
> Ages on ages before any eyes could see  
> year after year  
> thunderously pounding the shore as now.  
> For whom, for what?  
> On a dead planet  
> with no life to entertain.  
> Never at rest  
> tortured by energy  
> wasted prodigiously by the sun  
> poured into space.  
> A mite makes the sea roar.  
> Deep in the sea  
> all molecules repeat  
> the patterns of one another  
> till complex new ones are formed.  
> They make others like themselves  
> and a new dance starts.  
> Growing in size and complexity  
> living things  
> masses of atoms  
> DNA, protein  
> dancing a pattern ever more intricate.  
> Out of the cradle  
> onto dry land  
> here it is  
> standing:  
> atoms with consciousness;  
> matter with curiosity.  
> Stands at the sea,  
> wonders at wondering: I  
> a universe of atoms  
> an atom in the universe.
