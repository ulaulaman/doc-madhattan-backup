_A good pi day to all readers! I hope that the following post, that I cannot review after the first writing, could be interesting to all!_

The technique used by the ancient Greek for their geometric constructions was called "ruler and compass". In this way you can build a lot of regular polygons, for example, but there are three problems that are impossible unless you use different techniques: the angle trisection, doubling the cube, squaring the circle.  
In particular for the squaring, it is easy to calculate the relation between the radius $r$ of the circke and the side $l$ of the square with the same area of the starting circle: \\\[L = \\sqrt {\\pi} r \\\] Now, since $\\pi$ is a transcendental number, the formula above is the simplest representation of the impossibility of squaring the circle using ruler and compass: with these devices you can treat rational and irrational numbers, such as $\\sqrt{2}$ (in this case simply draw a square of side 1).  
So, using these two tools it is possible to obtain an approximate construction and, therefore, a corresponding approximate value for $\\pi$: during the XX century there are produced a lot of approximations, for example by **CD Olds** (1963), **Martin Gardner** (1966), **Benjamin Bold** (1982). They are all variations of the geometric construction discovered by **Srinivasa Ramanujan** in 1913, that approached $\\pi$ with the fraction \\\[\\frac{355}{113} = 3.1415929203539823008 \\dots\\\] right up to the sixth decimal place.  
In 1914, Ramanujan discovered a more accurate approximation (to eight decimal places), always using ruler and compass: \\\[\\left (9^2 + \\frac{19}{22}^2 \\right)^{1/4} = \\sqrt\[4\]{\\frac{2143}{22}} = 3.1415926525826461252 \\dots\\\]

If however, to compass and ruler we add a bit of mechanics, we can get an interesting way to square the circle (with a subsequent measure of $\\pi$!). Take a circle of radius $r$ and let's roll with constant speed along its tangent line. The point of tangency $N$ describe a curve called a cycloid.  
Now you can construct a second cycloid using the projection of the point $M$ on the tangent line. The intersection $B$ between the diameter $NN'$ with this second cycloid will provide a segment $NB$ whose length is equal to $\\sqrt{\\pi} r$, which is the side of the square with the same area of the starting circle. In this way, using a bit of algebra, is it also possible to determine the value of $\\pi$.  
But this construction is not simply geometric, but we can also do it really, perhaps with a small brass disc as suggested by **August Zielinski**, the proponent of the method of squaring just now briefly described.  
Obviously in this case the precision of the value of $\\pi$ depends on the accuracy of the devices used.

_Calvin & Hobbes_ by **Bill Watterson**

Among the many formulas used to calculate $\\pi$, a special place is held by the _Wallis product_, discovered more or less by an accident by the mathematician **John Wallis**, as he was trying to calculate the area of ​​a circle. \\\[\\prod\_{n=1}^\\infty \\left ( \\frac{2n}{2n-1} \\cdot \\frac{2n}{2n+1} \\right ) = \\frac{2}{1} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot {4}{3} \\cdot \\frac{4}{5} \\cdots = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\\] Wallis presented his formula in his most famous book, _Arithmetica infinitorum_ (arithmetic of the infinite) of 1665, essential for the **Isaac Newtons**'s training, who became his successor as a landmark of British mathematicians.  
However, the history of the formula began in Italy in 1632 with the publication of _Lo Specchio Ustorio, overo, Trattato delle settioni coniche_ (the burning glass, or a treatise about conic sections) where the mathematician **Bonaventura Cavalieri** calculates the area under "parables" of type $y = x^n$. Cavalieri proceeded by calculating the area between the axes and curves of type \\\[y = \\left ( 1-x^2 \\right )^0, \\; y= \\left ( 1-x^2 \\right )^1 \\; y= \\left ( 1-x^2 \\right )^2\\; y= \\left ( 1-x^2 \\right )^3, \\; \\cdots\\\] obtaining \\\[x,\\\] \\\[x - \\frac{1}{3} x^3,\\\] \\\[x - \\frac{2}{3} x^3 + \\frac{1}{5} x^5,\\\] \\\[x - \\frac{3}{3} x^3 + \\frac{3}{5} x^5 - \\frac{1}{7} x^7,\\\] \\\[x - \\frac{4}{3} x^3 + \\frac{6}{5} x^5 - \\frac{4}{7} x^7 + \\frac{1}{9} x^9,\\\] \\\[\\cdots\\\] Since the equation of the circle of radius 1 is $y = \\left (1-x^2 \\right)^{1/2}$, the problem reduces to determining the expression corresponding to the exponent $\\frac{1}{2}$ between $x$ and $x - \\frac{1}{3} x^3$.  
Unable to determine the expression, Wallis completed a series of numerical calculations that led him eventually to the formula that bears his name.

A more or less simple proof of the formula passes through the definition of three new series and the numerical calculation of the area of ​​rectangles in the Cartesian plane: already just looking at the picture below is easy to understand how these series, approximating the rectangles, to the limit they approach the arc of a circle, so converging to the value of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.  
A more rigorous demonstration, however, that takes the road of the proof of the formula of Cavalieri, passes through the integral of the breast \\\[\\int\_0^\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\sin^n x dx\\\] It is also possible, using suitably the Dirichlet eta function, to determine a link between the Riemann zeta and the formula of Wallis, which is also quite obvious because the Riemann zeta is linked to pi.
