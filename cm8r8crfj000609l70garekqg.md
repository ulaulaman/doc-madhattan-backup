_Atomics for the millions_ by **Maxwell Leigh Edinoff** and **Hyman Ruchlis** was the first book illustrated by **Maurice Sendak**.  
In this post I propose you some illustration from the book that I found on the blog [Collection children's books](http://collectingchildrensbooks.blogspot.it/2009/03/arts-and-sciences.html):

I choise some illustrations from the post. In particular, after the Einstein's _portrait_, the following two: in the first we can see the dance of the atoms: they bound with others in order to compose molecules. In the second there is a brief pictoric description of the radiation (left) and of the core of a nuclear power:

But the last, I think represents the story of the mankind, and, in this way, the only choice for our destiny seems logic. Or not?
