> Almost 14 billion years ago, the universe we inhabit burst into existence in an extraordinary event that initiated the Big Bang. In the first fleeting fraction of a second, the universe expanded exponentially, stretching far beyond the view of our best telescopes. All this, of course, was just theory.  
> Researchers from the BICEP2 collaboration today announced the first direct evidence for this cosmic inflation. Their data also represent the first images of gravitational waves, or ripples in space-time. These waves have been described as the "first tremors of the Big Bang." Finally, the data confirm a deep connection between quantum mechanics and general relativity.

(from the [press release](http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/2014-05))

> In physics, **gravitational waves** are ripples in the curvature of spacetime that propagate as a wave, travelling outward from the source. Predicted in 1916 by **Albert Einstein** to exist on the basis of his theory of general relativity, gravitational waves theoretically transport energy as **gravitational radiation**. Sources of detectable gravitational waves could possibly include binary star systems composed of white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. The existence of gravitational waves is a possible consequence of the Lorentz invariance of general relativity since it brings the concept of a limiting speed of propagation of the physical interactions with it. Gravitational waves cannot exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, in which physical interactions propagate at infinite speed.

(from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave)) Cosmic inflation was introduced by **Alan Guth** and **Andrei Linde** in 1981:

> One of the intriguing consequences of inflation is that quantum fluctuations in the early universe can be stretched to astronomical proportions, providing the seeds for the large scale structure of the universe. The predicted spectrum of these fluctuations was calculated by Guth and others in 1982. These fluctuations can be seen today as ripples in the cosmic background radiation, but the amplitude of these faint ripples is only about one part in 100,000. Nonetheless, these ripples were detected by the COBE satellite in 1992, and they have now been measured to much higher precision by the WMAP satellite and other experiments. The properties of the radiation are found to be in excellent agreement with the predictions of the simplest models of inflation.

So **our universe is born after a quantum blink of an eye**, or like a solution of [the equation of everything](http://docmadhattan.fieldofscience.com/2013/07/the-equation-of-everything.html).  
In the following a storify with a collection of link about one of the most important discovery of the... universe!
